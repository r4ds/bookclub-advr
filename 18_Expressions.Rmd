**Learning objectives:**

* Understand the idea of the abstract syntax tree (AST). 
* Discuss the data structures that underlie the AST:
  * Constants
  * Symbols
  * Calls
* Explore the idea behind parsing.
* Explore some details of R's grammar.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(rlang)
library(lobstr)
```
## Introduction

> To compute on the language, we first need to understand its structure.

* This requires a few things:
  * New vocabulary.
  * New tools to inspect and modify expressions.
  * Approach the use of the language with new ways of thinking.
* One of the first new ways of thinking is the distinction between an operation and its result.

```{r, error = TRUE}
y <- x * 10
```

* We can capture the intent of the code without executing it using the rlang package.

```{r}
z <- rlang::expr(y <- x * 10)

z
```

* We can then evaluate the expression using the **base::eval** function.

```{r}
x <- 4

base::eval(expr(y <- x * 10))

y
```

### Evaluating multiple expressions 

* We can write multiple expressions at once and it acts similar to `source()`.

* `expression()` returns a vector and can be passed to `eval()`.

```{r}
eval(expression(x <- 4, x * 10))
```

`exprs()` does not and has to be used in a loop

```{r}
for (i in exprs(x <- 4, x * 10)) {
print(i)
print(eval(i))
}
```

## Abstract Syntact Tree (AST)

* Expressions are objects that capture the structure of code without evaluating it.
* Expressions are also called abstract syntax trees (ASTs) because the structure of code is hierarchical and can be naturally represented as a tree. 
* Understanding this tree structure is crucial for inspecting and modifying expressions.
  * Branches = Calls
  * Leaves = Symbols and constants

```{r,eval=FALSE}
f(x, "y", 1)
```

### With `lobstr::ast():`

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(x, "y", 1))
```

* Some functions might also contain more calls like the example below:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
f(g(1, 2), h(3, 4, i())):
```
![](images/complicated.png)

```{r}
lobstr::ast(f(g(1, 2), h(3, 4, i())))
```
* Read the **hand-drawn diagrams** from left-to-right (ignoring vertical position)
* Read the **lobstr-drawn diagrams** from top-to-bottom (ignoring horizontal position).
* The depth within the tree is determined by the nesting of function calls. 
* Depth also determines evaluation order, **as evaluation generally proceeds from deepest-to-shallowest, but this is not guaranteed because of lazy evaluation**.

##  Infix calls

> Every call in R can be written in tree form because any call can be written in prefix form.

```{r eval=FALSE}
y <- x * 10
`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10))
```

* Since this is a characteristic of the language, regardless if it's a function written in infix or prefix form, all function calls can be represented using an AST.

![](images/prefix.png)

```{r}
lobstr::ast(y <- x * 10)
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10)))
```

* There is no difference between the ASTs, and if you generate an expression with prefix calls, R will still print it in infix form:

```{r}
rlang::expr(`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10)))
```

## Expression components 

* Collectively, the data structures present in the AST are called expressions.
* These include:
  1. Constants
  2. Symbols
  3. Calls 
  4. Pairlists

## Constants

* Scalar constants are the simplest component of the AST. 
* A constant is either **NULL** or a **length-1** atomic vector (or scalar) 
  * e.g., `TRUE`, `1L`, `2.5` or `x`. 
* We can test for a constant with **rlang::is_syntactic_literal()**.
* Constants are self-quoting in the sense that the expression used to represent a constant is the same constant:

```{r}
identical(expr(TRUE), TRUE)
# [1] TRUE
identical(expr(1), 1)
# [1] TRUE
identical(expr(2L), 2L)
# [1] TRUE
identical(expr("x"), "x")
# [1] TRUE
```

## Symbols

* A symbol represents the name of an object.
  * `x`
  * `mtcars`
  * `mean`. 
* In base R, the terms symbol and name are used interchangeably (i.e. `is.name()` is identical to `is.symbol()`), but this book used symbol consistently because **“name”** has many other meanings.
* You can create a symbol in two ways: 
  1. by capturing code that references an object with `expr()`.
  2. turning a string into a symbol with `rlang::sym():`.

```{r}
expr(x)
```

```{r}
sym("x")
```

* A symbol can be turned back into a string with `as.character()` or `rlang::as_string()`. 
* `as_string()` has the advantage of clearly signalling that you’ll get a character vector of length 1.

```{r}
as_string(expr(x))
```

* We can recognise a symbol because it’s printed without quotes
* `str()` tells you that it’s a symbol, and `is.symbol()` is TRUE:

```{r}
str(expr(x))
```

```{r}
is.symbol(expr(x))
```

* The symbol type is not vectorised, i.e. a symbol is always length 1. 
* If you want multiple symbols, you’ll need to put them in a list, using `rlang::syms()`.

## Calls

* A call object represents a captured function call. 
* Call objects are a special type of list. 
  * The first component specifies the function to call (usually a symbol). 
  * The remaining elements are the arguments for that call. 
* Call objects create branches in the AST, because calls can be nested inside other calls.
* You can identify a call object when printed because it looks just like a function call. 
* Confusingly `typeof()` and `str()` print language for call objects, but `is.call()` returns TRUE:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(read.table("important.csv", row.names = FALSE))
```

```{r}
x <- expr(read.table("important.csv", row.names = FALSE))
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
is.call(x)
```

## Subsetting

* Calls generally behave like lists.
* Since they are list like, you can use standard subsetting tools. 
* The first element of the call object is the function to call, which is usually a symbol:

```{r}
x[[1]]
```

```{r}
is.symbol(x[[1]])
```
* The remainder of the elements are the arguments:

```{r}
as.list(x[-1])
```
* We can extract individual arguments with [[ or, if named, $:

```{r}
x[[2]]
```

```{r}
x$row.names
```

* We can determine the number of arguments in a call object by subtracting 1 from its length:

```{r}
length(x) - 1
```

* Extracting specific arguments from calls is challenging because of R’s flexible rules for argument matching:
  * It could potentially be in any location, with the full name, with an abbreviated name, or with no name. 

* To work around this problem, you can use **rlang::call_standardise()** which standardises all arguments to use the full name:

```{r}
rlang::call_standardise(x)
```

* But If the function uses ... it’s not possible to standardise all arguments.
* Calls can be modified in the same way as lists:

```{r}
x$header <- TRUE
x
```

## Function position

* The first element of the call object is the function position. This contains the function that will be called when the object is evaluated, and is usually a symbol.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(foo())
```

* While R allows you to surround the name of the function with quotes, the parser converts it to a symbol:

```{r}
lobstr::ast("foo"())
```

* However, sometimes the function doesn’t exist in the current environment and you need to do some computation to retrieve it: 
  * For example, if the function is in another package, is a method of an R6 object, or is created by a function factory. In this case, the function position will be occupied by another call:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(pkg::foo(1))
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(obj$foo(1))
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(foo(1)(2))
```

![](images/call-call.png)

## Constructing

* You can construct a call object from its components using rlang::call2(). 
* The first argument is the name of the function to call (either as a string, a symbol, or another call).
* The remaining arguments will be passed along to the call:

```{r}
call2("mean", x = expr(x), na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
call2(expr(base::mean), x = expr(x), na.rm = TRUE)
```

* Infix calls created in this way still print as usual.

```{r}
call2("<-", expr(x), 10)
```

## Parsing and grammar

* **Parsing** - The process by which a computer language takes a string and constructs an expression. Parsing is governed by a set of rules known as a grammar. 
* We are going to use **lobstr::ast()** to explore some of the details of R’s grammar, and then show how you can transform back and forth between expressions and strings.
* **Operator precedence** - Conventions used by the programming language to resolve ambiguity.
* Infix functions introduce two sources of ambiguity.
* The first source of ambiguity arises from infix functions: what does 1 + 2 * 3 yield? Do you get 9 (i.e. (1 + 2) * 3), or 7 (i.e. 1 + (2 * 3))? In other words, which of the two possible parse trees below does R use?

![](images/ambig-order.png)

* Programming languages use conventions called operator precedence to resolve this ambiguity. We can use **ast()** to see what R does:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```

* PEMDAS is pretty clear on what to do. Other operator precedence isn't as clear. 
* There’s one particularly surprising case in R: 
  * ! has a much lower precedence (i.e. it binds less tightly) than you might expect. 
  * This allows you to write useful operations like:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(!x %in% y)
```
* **R has over 30 infix operators divided into 18 precedence** groups. 
* While the details are described in **?Syntax**, very few people have memorised the complete ordering.
* If there’s any confusion, use parentheses!

```{r}
# override PEMDAS
lobstr::ast((1 + 2) * 3)
```

## Associativity

* The second source of ambiguity is introduced by repeated usage of the same infix function. 

```{r}
1 + 2 + 3

# What does R do first?
(1 + 2) + 3

# or
1 + (2 + 3)
```

* In this case it doesn't matter. Other places it might, like in `ggplot2`. 

* In R, most operators are left-associative, i.e. the operations on the left are evaluated first:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 + 3)
```

* There's two exceptions to this rule:
  1. exponentiation
  2. assignment

```{r eval=FALSE}
lobstr::ast(2 ^ 2 ^ 3)
# █─`^`
# ├─2
# └─█─`^`
#   ├─2
#   └─3
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(x <- y <- z)
# █─`<-`
# ├─x
# └─█─`<-`
#   ├─y
#   └─z
```

## Parsing and deparsing

* Parsing - turning characters you've typed into an AST.
* R usually takes care of parsing code for us. 
* But occasionally you have code stored as a string, and you want to parse it yourself. 
* You can do so using **rlang::parse_expr()**:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x1 <- "y <- x + 10"
x1
# [1] "y <- x + 10"
is.call(x1)
# [1] FALSE
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
x2 <- rlang::parse_expr(x1)
x2
# y <- x + 10
is.call(x2)
# [1] TRUE
```

* **parse_expr()** always returns a single expression.
* If you have multiple expression separated by ; or \n, you’ll need to use **rlang::parse_exprs()**. It returns a list of expressions:

```{r}
x3 <- "a <- 1; a + 1"
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
rlang::parse_exprs(x3)
# [[1]]
# a <- 1
# 
# [[2]]
# a + 1
# 
```

* If you do this a lot, **quasiquotation** may be a safer approach.
  * More about this in Chapter 19.
* The inverse of parsing is deparsing.
* **Deparsing** - given an expression, you want the string that would generate it. 
* This happens automatically when you print an expression.
* You can get the string with **rlang::expr_text()**:
* Parsing and deparsing are not symmetric.
  * Parsing creates the AST.

```{r}
z <- expr(y <- x + 10)
```
 
```{r}
expr_text(z)
```

## Using the AST to solve more complicated problems

* Here we focus on what we learned to perform recursion on the AST.
* Two parts of a recursive function:
  * Recursive case
  * Base case
* These two parts correspond well to tree like data structures.

## Two helper functions

* First, we need an `epxr_type()` function to return the type of expression element as a string.

```{r}
expr_type <- function(x) {
  if (rlang::is_syntactic_literal(x)) {
    "constant"
  } else if (is.symbol(x)) {
    "symbol"
  } else if (is.call(x)) {
    "call"
  } else if (is.pairlist(x)) {
    "pairlist"
  } else {
    typeof(x)
  }
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
expr_type(expr("a"))
# [1] "constant"
expr_type(expr(x))
# [1] "symbol"
expr_type(expr(f(1, 2)))
# [1] "call"
```

* Second, we need a wrapper function to handle exceptions.

```{r}
switch_expr <- function(x, ...) {
  switch(expr_type(x),
    ...,
    stop("Don't know how to handle type ", typeof(x), call. = FALSE)
  )
}
```

* Lastly, we can write a basic template that walks the AST using the `switch()` statement.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
recurse_call <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    # Base cases
    symbol = ,
    constant = ,

    # Recursive cases
    call = ,
    pairlist =
  )
}
```

## Specific use cases for `recurse_call()`

### Example 1: Finding F and T

* Using `F` and `T` in our code rather than `FALSE` and `TRUE` is bad practice.
* Say we want to walk the AST to find times when we use `F` and `T`.
* Start off by finding the type of `T` vs `TRUE`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
expr_type(expr(TRUE))
# [1] "constant"

expr_type(expr(T))
# [1] "symbol"
```

* With this knowledge, we can now write the base cases of our recursive function.
* The logic is as follows:
  * A constant is never a logical abberviation and a symbol is an abbreviation if it's "F" or "T":

```{r}
logical_abbr_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    constant = FALSE,
    symbol = as_string(x) %in% c("F", "T")
  )
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
logical_abbr_rec(expr(TRUE))
# [1] FALSE
logical_abbr_rec(expr(T))
# [1] TRUE
```

* It's best practice to write another wrapper, assuming every input you receive will be an expression.

```{r}
logical_abbr <- function(x) {
  logical_abbr_rec(enexpr(x))
}

logical_abbr(T)
# [1] TRUE
logical_abbr(FALSE)
# [1] FALSE
```

### Next step: code for the recursive cases

* Here we want to do the same thing for calls and for pairlists.
* Here's the logic: recursively apply the function to each subcomponent, and return `TRUE` if any subcomponent contains a logical abbreviation.
* This is simplified by using the `purrr::some()` function, which iterates over a list and returns `TRUE` if the predicate function is true for any element.

```{r}
logical_abbr_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
  # Base cases
  constant = FALSE,
  symbol = as_string(x) %in% c("F", "T"),
  # Recursive cases
  call = ,
  # Are we sure this is the correct function to use?
  # Why not logical_abbr_rec?
  pairlist = purrr::some(x, logical_abbr_rec)
  )
}

logical_abbr(mean(x, na.rm = T))
# [1] TRUE

logical_abbr(function(x, na.rm = T) FALSE)
# [1] TRUE
```

## Example 2: Finding all variables created by assignment

* Listing all the variables is a little more complicated. 
* Figure out what assignment looks like based on the AST.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ast(x <- 10)
# █─`<-`
# ├─x
# └─10
```

* Now we need to decide what data structure we're going to use for the results.
  * Easiest thing will be to return a character vector.
  * We would need to use a list if we wanted to return symbols.

### Dealing with the base cases

```{r eval=FALSE}
find_assign_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    constant = ,
    symbol = character()
  )
}
find_assign <- function(x) find_assign_rec(enexpr(x))

find_assign("x")
#> character(0)
find_assign(x)
#> character(0)
```

### Dealing with the recursive cases

* Here is the function to flatten pairlists.

```{r}
flat_map_chr <- function(.x, .f, ...) {
  purrr::flatten_chr(purrr::map(.x, .f, ...))
}

flat_map_chr(letters[1:3], ~ rep(., sample(3, 1)))
#> [1] "a" "b" "b" "b" "c" "c" "c"
```

* Here is the code needed to identify calls.

```{r eval=FALSE}
find_assign_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    # Base cases
    constant = ,
    symbol = character(),

    # Recursive cases
    pairlist = flat_map_chr(as.list(x), find_assign_rec),
    call = {
      if (is_call(x, "<-")) {
        as_string(x[[2]])
      } else {
        flat_map_chr(as.list(x), find_assign_rec)
      }
    }
  )
}

find_assign(a <- 1)
#> [1] "a"
find_assign({
  a <- 1
  {
    b <- 2
  }
})
#> [1] "a" "b"
```

### Make the function more robust

* Throw cases at it that we think might break the function. 
* Write a function to handle these cases.

```{r eval=FALSE}
find_assign_call <- function(x) {
  if (is_call(x, "<-") && is_symbol(x[[2]])) {
    lhs <- as_string(x[[2]])
    children <- as.list(x)[-1]
  } else {
    lhs <- character()
    children <- as.list(x)
  }

  c(lhs, flat_map_chr(children, find_assign_rec))
}

find_assign_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    # Base cases
    constant = ,
    symbol = character(),

    # Recursive cases
    pairlist = flat_map_chr(x, find_assign_rec),
    call = find_assign_call(x)
  )
}

find_assign(a <- b <- c <- 1)
#> [1] "a" "b" "c"
find_assign(system.time(x <- print(y <- 5)))
#> [1] "x" "y"
```

* This approach certainly is more complicated, but it's important to start simple and move up.

## Specialised data structures

* Pairlists
* Missing arguments 
* Expression vectors

##  Pairlists

* Pairlists are a remnant of R’s past and have been replaced by lists almost everywhere. 
* The only place you are likely to see pairlists in R is when working with calls to the function, as the formal arguments to a function are stored in a pairlist:

```{r}
f <- expr(function(x, y = 10) x + y)
```
```{r}
args <- f[[2]]
args
```
```{r}
typeof(args)
```
* Fortunately, whenever you encounter a pairlist, you can treat it just like a regular list:

```{r}
pl <- pairlist(x = 1, y = 2)
```

```{r}
length(pl)
```

```{r}
pl$x
```

## Missing arguments

* Empty symbols
* To create an empty symbol, you need to use `missing_arg()` or `expr()`.

```{r}
missing_arg()
typeof(missing_arg())
```

* Empty symbols don't print anything.
  * To check, we need to use `rlang::is_missing()`

```{r}
is_missing(missing_arg())
# [1] TRUE
```

* These are usually present in function formals:

```{r}
f <- expr(function(x, y = 10) x + y)
# function(x, y = 10) x + y
args <- f[[2]]
# $x
# 
# 
# $y
# [1] 10
# 
is_missing(args[[1]])
#> [1] TRUE
```

## Expression vectors

* An expression vector is just a list of expressions.
  * The only difference is that calling eval() on an expression evaluates each individual expression. 
  * Instead, it might be more advantageous to use a list of expressions.

* Expression vectors are only produced by two base functions: 
  `expression()` and `parse()`:

```{r}
exp1 <- parse(text = c("
x <- 4
x
"))
```

```{r}
exp2 <- expression(x <- 4, x)
```

```{r}
typeof(exp1)
typeof(exp2)
```

```{r}
exp1
exp2
```

- Like calls and pairlists, expression vectors behave like lists:

```{r}
length(exp1)
exp1[[1]]
```
