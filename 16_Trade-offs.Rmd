# Trade-offs

**Learning objectives:**

- Understand the Trade-offs between S3, R6 and S4

- Brief intro to S7 (the object system formerly known as R7)


## Introduction

* We have three OOP systems introduced so far (S3, S4, R6) 

* At the current time (pre - S7?) Hadley recommends use S3 by default: It's simple and widely used throughout base R and CRAN.

* If you have experience in other languages,  *Resist* the temptation to use R6 even though it will feel more familiar!


## S4 versus S3 

**Which functional object system to use, S4 or S3? **

- **S3** is a simple and flexible system.
   
   - Good for small teams who need flexibility and immediate payoffs.
   
   - Commonly used throughout base R and CRAN 
   
   - Flexibility can cause problems, more complex systems might require formal conventions
   

- **S4** is a more formal, strict system. 

   - Good for large projects and large teams
   
   - Used by Bioconductor project
   
   - Requires significant up front investment in design, but payoff is a robust system that enforces conventions.
   
   - S4 Documentation is challenging to use. 
    


## R6 versus S3

**R6** is built on **encapsulated objects**, rather than generic functions.   


**Big differences: general trade-offs**

```{r 16-Trade-offs-4, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/16-trade-offs.png")
```

## Namespacing {-}

**Where methods are found?**

- in S3, **Generic functions** are **global** and live in the **global namespace**

   - Advantage: Uniform API: `summary`, `print`, `predict` etc.
   
   - Disadvantage: Must be careful about creating new methods!  Homonyms must be avoided, don't define `plot(bank_heist)`
 

- in R6, **Encapsulated methods** are **local**: objects with a **scope**

   - Advantage: No problems with homonyms:  meaning of `bank_heist$plot()` is clear and unambiguous.
   
   - Disadvantage: Lack of a uniform API, except by convention.
   

## Threading state {-}


In S3 the challenge is to return a value and modify the object. 


```{r}
new_stack <- function(items = list()) {
  structure(list(items = items), class = "stack")
}

push <- function(x, y) {
  x$items <- c(x$items, list(y))
  x
}
```

No problem with that, but what about when we want to pop a value?  We need to return two things.

```{r}
pop <- function(x) {
  n <- length(x$items)
  
  item <- x$items[[n]]
  x$items <- x$items[-n]
  
  list(item = item, x = x)
}
```

The usage is a bit awkward:

```{r}
s <- new_stack()
s <- push(s, 10)
s <- push(s, 20)

out <- pop(s)
# Update state:
s <- out$x

print(out$item)
```


In python and other languages we have structured binding to make this less awkward.  R has the {zeallot} package. For more, see this vignette:

```{r 16-Trade-offs-5, eval=FALSE}
vignette('unpacking-assignment')
```

However, this is all easier in R6 due to the reference semantics!

```{r}
Stack <- R6::R6Class("Stack", list(
  items = list(),
  push = function(x) {
    self$items <- c(self$items, x)
    invisible(self)
  },
  pop = function() {
    item <- self$items[[self$length()]]
    self$items <- self$items[-self$length()]
    item
  },
  length = function() {
    length(self$items)
  }
))

s <- Stack$new()
s$push(10)
s$push(20)
s$pop()
```


## Method chaining {-}

Useful to compose functions from left-to-right.

Use of the operators:

- S3: `%>%`

- R6: `$`

```{r}
s$push(44)$push(32)$pop()
```


## Umm... what about S7 ? {-}

```{r standards, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap = "https://xkcd.com/927/"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards_2x.png")

```

### Primary references: {-}

* Docs: https://rconsortium.github.io/OOP-WG/

* Talk by Hadley Wickham https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3FxCvSueag

## S7 briefly {-}

* S7 is a 'better' version of S3 with some of the 'strictness' of S4.

```
"A little bit more complex then S3, with almost all of the features, 
all of the payoff of S4" - rstudio conf 2022, Hadley Wickham
```

* Compatible with S3: S7 objects are S3 objects!  Can even extend an S3 object with S7

* Somewhat compatible with S4, see [compatability vignette](https://rconsortium.github.io/OOP-WG/articles/compatibility.html) for details. 

* Helpful error messages! 

* Note that it was previously called R7, but it was changed to "S7" to better reflect that it is functional not encapsulated! 

## Abbreviated introduction based on the vignette {-}

To install: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rconsortium/OOP-WG")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(S7)
dog <- new_class("dog", properties = list(
  name = class_character,
  age = class_numeric
))
dog


#> <S7_class>
#> @ name  :  dog
#> @ parent: <S7_object>
#> @ properties:
#>  $ name: <character>          
#>  $ age : <integer> or <double>
```

Note the 'class_character', these are S7 classes corresponding to the base classes.

Now to use it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lola <- dog(name = "Lola", age = 11)
lola

#> <dog>
#>  @ name: chr "Lola"
#>  @ age : num 11
```

Properties can be set / read with '@', with automatic validation ('safety rails') based on the type!

```{r, eval = FALSE}

lola@age <- 12
lola@age

#> 12

lola@age <- "twelve"

#> Error: <dog>@age must be <integer> or <double>, not <character>

```

Note thehelpful error message!

Like S3 (and S4) S7 has generics, implemented with `new_generic` and `method` for particular methods:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
speak <- new_generic("speak", "x")

method(speak, dog) <- function(x) {
  "Woof"
}
  
speak(lola)

#> [1] "Woof"
```

If we have another class, we can implement the generic for that too:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cat <- new_class("cat", properties = list(
  name = class_character,
  age = class_double
))
method(speak, cat) <- function(x) {
  "Meow"
}

fluffy <- cat(name = "Fluffy", age = 5)
speak(fluffy)

#> [1] "Meow"
```

Helpful messages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
speak

#> <S7_generic> speak(x, ...) with 2 methods:
#> 1: method(speak, cat)
#> 2: method(speak, dog)
```


"most usage of S7 with S3 will just work"

```{r, eval = FALSE}
method(print, cat) <- function(...) {
  print("I am a cat.")
}

print(fluffy)
#> "I am a cat"

```

## So... switch to S7 ? {-}

$$
\huge
\textbf{Soon}^{tm}
$$

* Not yet... still in development! 

* But consider trying it out:

   * To stay ahead of the curve... S7 will be integrated into base R someday!
   
   * To contribute feedback to the S7 team!

   * To get "almost all" of the benefits of S4 without the complexity !  
   
* In particular, if you have a new project that might require the complexity of S4, consider S7 instead!
