00:08:47	Olivier Leroy:	Or [[]]
00:09:42	Jo Hardin:	sometimes i want the variable to have a specific format.  for example, in linear model output i want the variable to have a space in it (instead of an underscore).  then i’ll leave the space in the variable and use it throughout my code as `explan variable` or whatever.
