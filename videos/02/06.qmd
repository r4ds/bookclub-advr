00:16:57	Federica Gazzelloni:	cohort 2 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCiNj2JRK50
00:18:39	Federica Gazzelloni:	cohort 2 presentation: https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-Advanced_R/Presentations/Week02/Cohort2_America/Chapter2Slides.html#1
00:40:24	Arthur Shaw:	Just the opposite, Ryan. Very clear presentation!
00:51:54	Trevin:	parquet?
00:53:00	Arthur Shaw:	We may all be right. {arrow} looks to deal with feather and parquet files: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/
01:00:04	Arthur Shaw:	Some questions for future meetings. (1) I find Ryan's use of slides hugely effective in conveying information. Would it be OK if future sessions (optionally) used slides? If so, should/could we commit slides to some folder on the repo? (2) I think reusing the images from Hadley's books really helps understanding and discussion. Is that OK to do? Here I'm thinking about copyright concerns. (If possible, I would rather not redraw variants of Hadley's images.)
01:01:35	Federica Gazzelloni:	It's all ok, you can use past presentation, you don't need to push them to the repo, you can use the images from the book
01:07:19	Federica Gazzelloni:	Can I use: gc(reset = TRUE) safely?
