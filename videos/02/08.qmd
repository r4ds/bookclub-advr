00:13:07	Federica Gazzelloni (she/her):	http://r4ds.io/advr
00:15:46	Federica Gazzelloni (she/her):	start
00:52:35W	Rebecca Butler:	Does anyone know how to print out much more precision for obj_size?
00:53:02	Laura Biggins:	No, I was going to ask the same question.
00:53:48	Federica Gazzelloni (she/her):	https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/names-and-values
00:56:51	Rebecca Butler:	This is fun:
a <- runif(1e6)
a_size <- obj_size(a)

b <- list(a, a)
b_size <- obj_size(b)

b_size - a_size
# 64 B

x <- 1
y <- list(x, x)
obj_size(y) - obj_size(x)
# 64 B
00:58:40	Rebecca Butler:	Replying to "This is fun:
a <- ru..."

Kind of clarifies that it takes 64 B to make an empty list of length 2
00:58:58	Laura Biggins:	Replying to "This is fun:
a <- ru..."

> obj_size(list(NULL))
56 B
> obj_size(list(NULL, NULL))
64 B
> obj_size(list(NULL, NULL, NULL))
80 B
00:59:05	Rebecca Butler:	Replying to "This is fun:
a <- ru..."

empty_list2 <- vector("list", 2)
obj_size(empty_list2)
# 64 B

empty_list3 <- vector("list", 3)
obj_size(empty_list3)
# 80 B
00:59:32	Rebecca Butler:	Replying to "This is fun:
a <- ru..."

Haha we were going the exact same place, Laura. yep!
00:59:44	Laura Biggins:	Reacted to "Haha we were going t..." with 👍
01:04:22	Federica Gazzelloni (she/her):	stop
