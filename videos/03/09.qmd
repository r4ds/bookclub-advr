00:18:16	Olivier Leroy:	T is not a restricted name unlike TRUE:
00:18:17	Olivier Leroy:	> TRUE <-"bob"
Error in TRUE <- "bob" : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
> T <- "bob"
>

00:32:47	Olivier Leroy:	Brb just checking in an other book
00:36:12	Olivier Leroy:	> x <- 1L

00:52:18	Howard Baek:	From the help page:

An array in R can have one, two or more dimensions. It is simply a vector which is stored with additional attributes giving the dimensions (attribute "dim") and optionally names for those dimensions (attribute "dimnames").
A two-dimensional array is the same thing as a matrix.
