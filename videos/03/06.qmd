00:10:18	Oluwafemi Oyedele:	Hi, good evening
00:23:31	Federica Gazzelloni:	Hi Kiante!
00:24:21	Federica Gazzelloni:	Thanks Arthur
00:25:46	Trevin:	Welcome Matt!
00:26:02	Matt Dupree:	hello! thank you!
00:30:34	Federica Gazzelloni:	Hello Matt!
00:30:46	Matt Dupree:	hello!
00:38:24	Ryan Metcalf:	`rlang::cpl()` = “complex”. For example `0+1i`
00:55:37	Trevin:	> two <- c(1,2,3)
> names(two) <- c("one", "two")
> two
 one  two <NA> 
   1    2    3
00:57:25	Ryan Metcalf:	Excellent Trevin. You beat me to the output! Assuming we didn't supply the string, `NA` is entered instead.
01:08:50	Ryan Metcalf:	Without further research, this is the "Unix Epoch”. However, varying operating systems use different Epochs.
