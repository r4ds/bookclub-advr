00:36:02	Arthur Shaw:	TIL that the subset operator has parameters. Thanks, Trevin!
00:38:55	Vaibhav Janve:	its interesting that carriage "a" has two set of wheels instread of 4. I wonder that choice is because its atomic.
00:40:44	Arthur Shaw:	@Vaibhav, because the load is lighter, the carriage needs fewer axles? ;)  I agree: it's a confusing graphical choice.
00:41:11	Vaibhav Janve:	lol
01:05:53	Vaibhav Janve:	Thank you Trevin!
