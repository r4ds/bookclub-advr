00:12:04	Olivier Leroy:	Start
00:12:36	Olivier Leroy:	Great!
00:16:21	Olivier Leroy:	I also searched other examples I find some here: https://raps-with-r.dev/fprog.html#writing-good-functions (still unclear where/when for me)
00:17:24	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	Reacted to "I also searched othe..." with 👍
00:17:57	Jo Hardin:	is “binding” like “names"
00:20:03	Olivier Leroy:	(Did not about it also)
00:20:07	Olivier Leroy:	know
00:21:15	Olivier Leroy:	Good point
00:22:53	Jeff Stevens:	Mind blown! So glad you mentioned that.
00:23:19	Olivier Leroy:	Replying to "is “binding” like “n..."

About binding and name I like https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1.2 (disclaimer I never only read 2 chapter of it)
00:23:28	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "Mind blown! So glad ..." with 👍
00:26:33	Olivier Leroy:	I think I understood the super assignment as “write in global” for a long time
00:26:47	Jeff Stevens:	Replying to "I think I understood..."

Me too
00:26:53	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	Reacted to "I think I understood..." with 👍
00:26:58	Howard Baek:	Reacted to "I think I understood..." with 👍
00:27:12	Jeff Stevens:	Reacted to "I think I understood..." with 👍
00:30:25	Tinashe Tapera:	So does R have a global assignment at all?
00:31:02	Tinashe Tapera:	I’m sure it should out of software architecture mecessity
00:31:22	Olivier Leroy:	Replying to "So does R have a glo..."

No idea, if I want to force it I will assign to .globalenv
00:32:17	Tinashe Tapera:	Reacted to "No idea, if I want t…" with 👌
00:32:21	Olivier Leroy:	assign(x, env = .gloabenv)
00:32:22	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	Replying to "So does R have a glo..."

Yes, it looks like `assign()` has an `envir` parameter

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9726705/assign-multiple-objects-to-globalenv-from-within-a-function
00:32:52	Olivier Leroy:	Wrong spelling in .globalenv
00:33:52	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	sounds like a Data Mishaps Night story :-)
00:34:11	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "sounds like a Data M..." with 👻
00:34:27	Jeff Stevens:	Should we be doing garbage collection on all functions (not just function factories) to save memory?
00:34:36	Olivier Leroy:	I did not know that!
00:35:47	Jeff Stevens:	Awesome explanation--thanks!
00:35:52	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "Awesome explanation-..." with 👍
00:36:24	Olivier Leroy:	Or you cache outside and kill R
00:36:37	Tinashe Tapera:	Use targets
00:36:46	Tinashe Tapera:	That’s exactly what targets is for
00:36:55	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "That’s exactly what ..." with 👍
00:36:57	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	Reacted to "That’s exactly what ..." with 😻
00:38:36	Olivier Leroy:	-> https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories

(Good example)
00:43:10	Jo Hardin:	i’m excited about the `switch()` function you just showed!
00:43:23	Olivier Leroy:	Declarative is always nice on readability!
00:51:26	Olivier Leroy:	Yes very elegant to store stuff
00:51:55	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	all 5 functions in `funs` start with the same environment?
00:52:15	Olivier Leroy:	Replying to "all 5 functions in `..."

Good question
00:53:30	Olivier Leroy:	It seems attach can attach any kind of object that can be tricky
00:54:04	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	Replying to "all 5 functions in `..."

ah (I read too fast)
00:56:02	Olivier Leroy:	I use the ecdf one, not that frequently
00:59:35	Tinashe Tapera:	You’re justified in hating setwd() though
00:59:47	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	Reacted to "You’re justified in ..." with 😂
01:00:23	Derek Sollberger (he/him):	I doubt that I have seen any other book cover functional programming before OOP (and thank you for the walkthrough)
01:03:50	Diana Garcia Cortes:	Thank you Steffi!
01:03:56	Olivier Leroy:	end
