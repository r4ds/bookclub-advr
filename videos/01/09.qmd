00:24:34	Gabby Palomo Munoz:	BUT they are both in bookddown
00:24:52	Gabby Palomo Munoz:	SLIDES are the summarized version that each one of us create for each chapter
00:26:18	Gabby Palomo Munoz:	The idea is that we don't put everything there is in the chapter in the "slides". Just important relevant things. Snipets. Jon calls them slides because ideally you should put what you are presenting on what can be shown on the screen (like a slide) and avoid scrolling
00:26:30	Derek Sollberger:	Reacted to "The idea is that we ..." with 👍
00:26:37	Gabby Palomo Munoz:	BUT it's fine if your 'slide' has more info that you have to scroll through

00:45:47	Jo Hardin:	Reacted to "It's just to highlig..." with 👍
00:45:48	Gabby Palomo Munoz:	I think Jon designed it like that to help whoever is leading the book
00:47:31	Gabby Palomo Munoz:	One more thing, you don't have to know the content of the chapter and be an expert on that topic to present.
00:47:40	Derek Sollberger:	Reacted to "One more thing, you ..." with 👍
