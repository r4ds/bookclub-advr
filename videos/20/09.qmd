00:16:23	Olivier Leroy:	source
00:17:36	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	docs for rlang::parse_expr: 
These functions parse and transform text into R expressions. This is the first step to interpret or evaluate a piece of R code written by a programmer.
00:17:59	Olivier Leroy:	‘parse()’ returns the parsed but unevaluated expressions in an
     ‘expression’, a “list” of ‘call’s.
00:19:40	Olivier Leroy:	I have a “daily_year” project for this kind of stuff
00:20:42	Olivier Leroy:	You are doing great!
00:32:30	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	eval(rlang::get_expr(q), rlang::get_env(q)) same as 
rlang::eval_tidy(q)
00:33:41	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "eval(rlang::get_expr..." with 👍
00:34:00	Derek Sollberger:	Reacted to "eval(rlang::get_expr..." with 👍
00:34:30	Olivier Leroy:	That was intersting, learning the “mistakes” on the road
00:35:24	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	Definitely! Things like this always help me better understand
00:35:31	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "Definitely! Things l..." with 👍
00:42:33	Olivier Leroy:	Very clear explanation
00:43:11	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	Sometimes I use .env$x in workflows too, for maximum readibility and clarity :D
00:43:19	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "Sometimes I use .env..." with 👍
00:47:42	Olivier Leroy:	Just noticed you are using relative row number
00:48:16	Jo Hardin:	i noticed the row numbering, too, but i don’t understand it!  what is relative row numbering?
00:50:52	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "i noticed the row nu..." with 👍
00:59:14	Jo Hardin:	{{ variable }}
00:59:42	Derek Sollberger:	Replying to "{{ variable }}"

great for data masks?
00:59:53	Olivier Leroy:	Replying to "{{ variable }}"

{{variable}}

01:03:27	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	var_summary <- function(data, var) {
data %>%
summarise(n = n(), min = min({{ var }}), max = max({{ var }}))
}
mtcars %>% 
group_by(cyl) %>% 
var_summary(mpg)
01:04:16	Jo Hardin:	library(tidyverse)
my_func <- function(x){
  mtcars |> 
    select({{x}})
}

my_func(wt)
01:05:53	Steffi LaZerte (she/her):	Reacted to "library(tidyverse)
m..." with 👍🏻
