00:24:16	Olivier Leroy:	current env will change if you are using browser()() to debug
00:26:25	jim rothstein:	Question:   where does the value of "d" live?  in environment, in RAM?
00:27:06	Olivier Leroy:	ram I think
00:27:39	jim rothstein:	OK,   so "d" is reference to memory location
00:29:40	Olivier Leroy:	the memory location will be illustrated by obj_addr(d) (executqtes in correct env)
00:33:10	jim rothstein:	@Olivier Leroy Thx ... need to check later.
00:34:15	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "@Olivier Leroy Thx ...." with 👍
00:40:45	jim rothstein:	`<<-`  If such a
     variable is found (and its binding is not locked) then its value
     is redefined, otherwise assignment takes place in the global
00:41:47	jim rothstein:	x <<- 2    1st tries to find x in ANY parent
00:41:54	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	[main 12:35:50] > testing <- function() {
    a <<- "I'm in the global environment now!"
  }
[main 12:36:57] > a
Error: object 'a' not found

[main 12:36:57] > testing()
[main 12:36:58] > a
[1] "I'm in the global environment now!"
00:49:37	Olivier Leroy:	the art of R is giving an exampl;e of  <<-  in a event scheduler
00:50:21	jim rothstein:	fibinocci numbers
00:50:55	Olivier Leroy:	I needed the 4 first chapter of little schemer to sart getting it
00:51:16	Martín Venegas:	finding a variable inside a really nested list maybe?
00:52:21	jim rothstein:	@Martín Venegas  - think so
00:53:02	Martín Venegas:	Reacted to @Martín Venegas  - t... with "👌"
00:54:30	Martín Venegas:	so the order in package loads matters
00:55:02	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Replying to "so the order in pack..."

Yes! If two packages have a function with the same name, you'll get the most-recently-loaded version.
00:55:18	Retselisitsoe Monyake:	Reacted to "Yes! If two packag..." with 👍
00:55:22	Martín Venegas:	Reacted to Yes! If two packages... with "❤️"
