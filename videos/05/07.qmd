00:40:18	Ryan Honomichl:	What type of vector does each of the following calls to ifelse() return?
* "ifelse returns a value with the same shape as test which is filled with elements selected from either yes or no depending on whether the element of test is TRUE or FALSE."
00:42:11	Ryan Honomichl:	"I recommend assigning the results of an if statement only when the entire expression fits on one line; otherwise it tends to be hard to read"
00:42:46	Ryan Honomichl:	* When you use the single argument form without an `else` statement, `if` invisibly returns NULL if the condition is FALSE. 
-   Since functions like c() and paste() drop NULL inputs, this allows for a compact expression of certain idioms
