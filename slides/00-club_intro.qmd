## Book club meetings

-   Volunteer leads discussion of a chapter
    -   **This is the best way to learn the material.**
-   Presentations: 
    -   Review of material
    -   Questions you have
    -   Maybe live demo
-   More info about editing: [this github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-advr)
-   Ideally convert existing Rmd to qmd as we go
-   Recorded, available on the [Data Science Learning Community YouTube Channel (DSLC.video)](http://dslc.video)

## Pace

-   **Goal:** 1 chapter/week
-   Ok to split overwhelming chapters
-   Ok to combine short chapters
-   Meet ***every*** week except holidays, etc
    -   We will meet even if scheduled presenter unavailable
    -   Push to finish before Daylight Savings Madness March 8

## Learning objectives (LOs)

-   Students who study with LOs in mind ***retain more***
-   **Tips:**
    -   Think "After today's session, you will be able to {LO}"
    -   *Very* roughly **1 per heading**

## Group introductions

- If you feel comfortable sharing:
  - Who are you?
  - Where you calling in from? (If you're not comfortable sharing, skip)
  - How long have you been using R?
  - What was your introduction to R?
  - What are you most looking forward to during the club?
