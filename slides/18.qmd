# To compute on the language, we first need to understand its structure.

## Learning objectives:

* Capture code expressions
* Inspect expressions
* Define expressions
* Modify expressions
* Generate expressions
* Identify grammar of parsing code
* Implement advanced code parsing

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(rlang)
library(lobstr)
```

## `expr` captures code without executing

*   Distinguishes the _operation_ from the _result_

::: panel-tabset

### Operation

*   Capture code as an __expression__

```{r}
z <- rlang::expr(x * 10)
z
rlang::is_expression(z)
class(z)
```

### Result

*   Evaluate the code expression __immediately__

```{r, error = TRUE}
y <- x * 10
```

:::

## `eval` evaluates the code expression

```{r}
z <- rlang::expr(x * 10)
x <- 10
eval(z)
```

::: callout-note
This chapter focuses on capturing and inspecting the _operation_. `eval` will be discussed more in chapters 19 and 20.
:::

## `ast` parses and identifies the parts of an expression

*   Expressions are also called abstract syntax trees (ASTs) because of the hierarchical structure and natural tree representation. 

::: panel-tabset

### Using infix notation

```{r}
lobstr::ast(y <- x * 10)
```

### Using prefix notation

```{r}
lobstr::ast(`<-`(y,`*`(x,10)))
```

:::

## The leaves, branches, and colors from `ast` identify expression data structures

![](images/prefix.png)

::: panel-tabset

### Constants

*   Also called scalars
*   Found in `ast` leaves
*   Leaves have black borders and sharp corners
*   Identify with `rlang::is_syntactic_literal`

### Symbols

*   Found in `ast` leaves
*   Leaves have purple borders and rounded corners
*   Identify with `is.name` or `is.symbol`
*   Convert strings to symbols with `rlang::sym` or `rlang::syms`
*   Convert a symbol to a string with `rlang::as_string`  or `as.character`

### Calls

*   Found in `ast` branches.
*   Branches are orange rectangles
*   First child is the function call name
*   Subsequent children are arguments to the function call
*   Calls behave as lists
*   `typeof` and `str` return "language" for call objects

:::

## Expressions can be modified using list subsetting

::: panel-tabset

### Inspect

```{r}
x <- rlang::expr(10*2)
str(x)
rlang::is_list(x)
rlang::is_expression(x)
purrr::map(as.list(x),~{.x})
```

### Modify

```{r}
tracemem(x)
x
x[[2]] <- 4
x
untracemem(x)
```

:::

## Expressions can be generated using `call2` or `expr`

::: panel-tabset

### Generate using `call2`

Clunky  for more complex  expressions, see chapter 19 for more details

```{r}
rlang::call2("mean", x = rlang::expr(x), na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Generate & filters

```{r}
and_filters <- 
  purrr::map(
    letters[6:8], #f, g, h
    ~{
      rlang::expr(.data[["x"]] < !!.x)
     }
  ) |> 
    purrr::reduce(
      .f = function(left, right) {
        rlang::expr(!!left & !!right)
      }
    )
tibble::tibble(
  x = letters
) |> 
  dplyr::filter(!!!and_filters)

```

### Generate | filters

```{r}
or_filters <- 
  purrr::map(
    letters[6:8], #f, g, h
    ~{
      rlang::expr(.data[["x"]] < !!.x)
     }
  ) |> 
    purrr::reduce(
      .f = function(left, right) {
        rlang::expr(!!left | !!right)
      }
    )
tibble::tibble(
  x = letters
) |> 
  dplyr::filter(!!!or_filters)
```

## Parsing and grammar

* **Parsing** - The process by which a computer language takes a string and constructs an expression. Parsing is governed by a set of rules known as a grammar. 
* We are going to use `lobstr::ast()` to explore some of the details of R’s grammar, and then show how you can transform back and forth between expressions and strings.
* **Operator precedence** - Conventions used by the programming language to resolve ambiguity.
* Infix functions introduce two sources of ambiguity.
* The first source of ambiguity arises from infix functions: what does 1 + 2 * 3 yield? Do you get 9 (i.e., (1 + 2) * 3), or 7 (i.e., 1 + (2 * 3))? In other words, which of the two possible parse trees below does R use?

![](images/ambig-order.png)

* Programming languages use conventions called operator precedence to resolve this ambiguity. We can use `ast()` to see what R does:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 * 3)
```

* PEMDAS (or BEDMAS or BODMAS, depending on where in the world you grew up) is pretty clear on what to do. Other operator precedence isn't as clear. 
* There’s one particularly surprising case in R: 
  * ! has a much lower precedence (i.e., it binds less tightly) than you might expect. 
  * This allows you to write useful operations like:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(!x %in% y)
```
* **R has over 30 infix operators divided into 18 precedence** groups. 
* While the details are described in `?Syntax`, very few people have memorized the complete ordering.
* If there’s any confusion, use parentheses!

```{r}
# override PEMDAS
lobstr::ast((1 + 2) * 3)
```

### Associativity

* The second source of ambiguity is introduced by repeated usage of the same infix function. 

```{r}
1 + 2 + 3

# What does R do first?
(1 + 2) + 3

# or
1 + (2 + 3)
```

* In this case it doesn't matter. Other places it might, like in `ggplot2`. 

* In R, most operators are left-associative, i.e., the operations on the left are evaluated first:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(1 + 2 + 3)
```

* There are two exceptions to the left-associative rule:
  1. exponentiation
  2. assignment

```{r}
lobstr::ast(2 ^ 2 ^ 3)
```

```{r}
lobstr::ast(x <- y <- z)
```

### Parsing and deparsing

* Parsing - turning characters you've typed into an AST (i.e., from strings to expressions).
* R usually takes care of parsing code for us. 
* But occasionally you have code stored as a string, and you want to parse it yourself. 
* You can do so using `rlang::parse_expr()`:

```{r}
x1 <- "y <- x + 10"
x1
is.call(x1)
```

```{r}
x2 <- rlang::parse_expr(x1)
x2
is.call(x2)
```

* `parse_expr()` always returns a single expression.
* If you have multiple expression separated by `;` or `,`, you’ll need to use `rlang::parse_exprs()` which is the plural version of `rlang::parse_expr()`. It returns a list of expressions:

```{r}
x3 <- "a <- 1; a + 1"
```

```{r}
rlang::parse_exprs(x3)
```

* If you find yourself parsing strings into expressions often, **quasiquotation** may be a safer approach.
  * More about quasiquaotation in Chapter 19.
* The inverse of parsing is deparsing.
* **Deparsing** - given an expression, you want the string that would generate it. 
* Deparsing happens automatically when you print an expression.
* You can get the string with `rlang::expr_text()`:
* Parsing and deparsing are not symmetric.
  * Parsing creates the AST which means that we lose backticks around ordinary names, comments, and whitespace.

```{r}
cat(expr_text(expr({
  # This is a comment
  x <-             `x` + 1
})))
```

## Using the AST to solve more complicated problems

* Here we focus on what we learned to perform recursion on the AST.
* Two parts of a recursive function:
  * Recursive case: handles the nodes in the tree. Typically, you’ll do something to each child of a node, usually calling the recursive function again, and then combine the results back together again. For expressions, you’ll need to handle calls and pairlists (function arguments).
  * Base case: handles the leaves of the tree. The base cases ensure that the function eventually terminates, by solving the simplest cases directly. For expressions, you need to handle symbols and constants in the base case.


### Two helper functions

* First, we need an `epxr_type()` function to return the type of expression element as a string.

```{r}
expr_type <- function(x) {
  if (rlang::is_syntactic_literal(x)) {
    "constant"
  } else if (is.symbol(x)) {
    "symbol"
  } else if (is.call(x)) {
    "call"
  } else if (is.pairlist(x)) {
    "pairlist"
  } else {
    typeof(x)
  }
}
```

```{r}
expr_type(expr("a"))
expr_type(expr(x))
expr_type(expr(f(1, 2)))
```

* Second, we need a wrapper function to handle exceptions.

```{r}
switch_expr <- function(x, ...) {
  switch(expr_type(x),
    ...,
    stop("Don't know how to handle type ", typeof(x), call. = FALSE)
  )
}
```

* Lastly, we can write a basic template that walks the AST using the `switch()` statement.

```{r,}
recurse_call <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    # Base cases
    symbol = ,
    constant = ,

    # Recursive cases
    call = ,
    pairlist =
  )
}
```

### Specific use cases for `recurse_call()`

### Example 1: Finding F and T

* Using `F` and `T` in our code rather than `FALSE` and `TRUE` is bad practice.
* Say we want to walk the AST to find times when we use `F` and `T`.
* Start off by finding the type of `T` vs `TRUE`.

```{r}
expr_type(expr(TRUE))

expr_type(expr(T))
```

* With this knowledge, we can now write the base cases of our recursive function.
* The logic is as follows:
  * A constant is never a logical abbreviation and a symbol is an abbreviation if it is "F" or "T":

```{r}
logical_abbr_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    constant = FALSE,
    symbol = as_string(x) %in% c("F", "T")
  )
}
```

```{r}
logical_abbr_rec(expr(TRUE))
logical_abbr_rec(expr(T))
```

* It's best practice to write another wrapper, assuming every input you receive will be an expression.

```{r}
logical_abbr <- function(x) {
  logical_abbr_rec(enexpr(x))
}

logical_abbr(T)
logical_abbr(FALSE)
```

#### Next step: code for the recursive cases

* Here we want to do the same thing for calls and for pairlists.
* Here's the logic: recursively apply the function to each subcomponent, and return `TRUE` if any subcomponent contains a logical abbreviation.
* This is simplified by using the `purrr::some()` function, which iterates over a list and returns `TRUE` if the predicate function is true for any element.

```{r}
logical_abbr_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
  # Base cases
  constant = FALSE,
  symbol = as_string(x) %in% c("F", "T"),
  # Recursive cases
  call = ,
  # Are we sure this is the correct function to use?
  # Why not logical_abbr_rec?
  pairlist = purrr::some(x, logical_abbr_rec)
  )
}

logical_abbr(mean(x, na.rm = T))

logical_abbr(function(x, na.rm = T) FALSE)
```

### Example 2: Finding all variables created by assignment

* Listing all the variables is a little more complicated. 
* Figure out what assignment looks like based on the AST.

```{r}
ast(x <- 10)
```

* Now we need to decide what data structure we're going to use for the results.
  * Easiest thing will be to return a character vector.
  * We would need to use a list if we wanted to return symbols.

### Dealing with the base cases

```{r}
find_assign_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    constant = ,
    symbol = character()
  )
}
find_assign <- function(x) find_assign_rec(enexpr(x))

find_assign("x")

find_assign(x)

```

### Dealing with the recursive cases

* Here is the function to flatten pairlists.

```{r}
flat_map_chr <- function(.x, .f, ...) {
  purrr::flatten_chr(purrr::map(.x, .f, ...))
}

flat_map_chr(letters[1:3], ~ rep(., sample(3, 1)))
```

* Here is the code needed to identify calls.

```{r}
find_assign_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    # Base cases
    constant = ,
    symbol = character(),

    # Recursive cases
    pairlist = flat_map_chr(as.list(x), find_assign_rec),
    call = {
      if (is_call(x, "<-")) {
        as_string(x[[2]])
      } else {
        flat_map_chr(as.list(x), find_assign_rec)
      }
    }
  )
}

find_assign(a <- 1)

find_assign({
  a <- 1
  {
    b <- 2
  }
})

```

### Make the function more robust

* Throw cases at it that we think might break the function. 
* Write a function to handle these cases.

```{r}
find_assign_call <- function(x) {
  if (is_call(x, "<-") && is_symbol(x[[2]])) {
    lhs <- as_string(x[[2]])
    children <- as.list(x)[-1]
  } else {
    lhs <- character()
    children <- as.list(x)
  }

  c(lhs, flat_map_chr(children, find_assign_rec))
}

find_assign_rec <- function(x) {
  switch_expr(x,
    # Base cases
    constant = ,
    symbol = character(),

    # Recursive cases
    pairlist = flat_map_chr(x, find_assign_rec),
    call = find_assign_call(x)
  )
}

find_assign(a <- b <- c <- 1)

find_assign(system.time(x <- print(y <- 5)))

```

* This approach certainly is more complicated, but it's important to start simple and move up.

## Specialised data structures

* Pairlists
* Missing arguments 
* Expression vectors

###  Pairlists

* Pairlists are a remnant of R’s past and have been replaced by lists almost everywhere. 
* The only place you are likely to see pairlists in R is when working with calls to the function, as the formal arguments to a function are stored in a pairlist:

```{r}
f <- expr(function(x, y = 10) x + y)
```

```{r}
args <- f[[2]]
args
```

```{r}
typeof(args)
```
* Fortunately, whenever you encounter a pairlist, you can treat it just like a regular list:

```{r}
pl <- pairlist(x = 1, y = 2)
```

```{r}
length(pl)
```

```{r}
pl$x
```

### Missing arguments

* Empty symbols
* To create an empty symbol, you need to use `missing_arg()` or `expr()`.

```{r}
missing_arg()
typeof(missing_arg())
```

* Empty symbols don't print anything.
  * To check, we need to use `rlang::is_missing()`

```{r}
is_missing(missing_arg())
```

* These are usually present in function formals:

```{r}
f <- expr(function(x, y = 10) x + y)

args <- f[[2]]


is_missing(args[[1]])
```

### Expression vectors

* An expression vector is just a list of expressions.
  * The only difference is that calling `eval()` on an expression evaluates each individual expression. 
  * Instead, it might be more advantageous to use a list of expressions.

* Expression vectors are only produced by two base functions: 
  `expression()` and `parse()`:

```{r}
exp1 <- parse(text = c(" 
x <- 4
x
"))
exp1
```

```{r}
exp2 <- expression(x <- 4, x)
exp2
```

```{r}
typeof(exp1)
typeof(exp2)
```


- Like calls and pairlists, expression vectors behave like lists:

```{r}
length(exp1)
exp1[[1]]
```
