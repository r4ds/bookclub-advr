## What are functionals {-}

## Introduction 

__Functionals__ are functions that take function as input and return a vector as output. Functionals that you probably have used before are: `apply()`, `lapply()` or `tapply()`. 


- alternatives to loops

- a functional is better than a `for` loop is better than `while` is better than `repeat`


### Benefits {-}


- encourages function logic to be separated from iteration logic

- can collapse into vectors/data frames easily


## Map

`map()` has two arguments, a vector and a function. It performs the function on each element of the vector and returns a list. We can also pass in some additional argument into the function.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = 'images/9_2_3_map-arg.png')
```

```{r}
simple_map <- function(x, f, ...) {
out <- vector("list", length(x))
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
out[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], ...)
}
out
}
```

## Benefit of using the map function in purrr {-}

- `purrr::map()` is equivalent to `lapply()`

- returns a list and is the most general

- the length of the input == the length of the output

- `map()` is more flexible, with additional arguments allowed

- `map()` has a host of extensions



```{r load,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Atomic vectors {-}


- has 4 variants to return atomic vectors
    - `map_chr()`
    - `map_dbl()`
    - `map_int()`
    - `map_lgl()`

```{r}
triple <- function(x) x * 3
map(.x=1:3, .f=triple)

map_dbl(.x=1:3, .f=triple)

map_lgl(.x=c(1, NA, 3), .f=is.na)
```

## Anonymous functions and shortcuts  {-}

 **Anonymous functions** 
```{r}
map_dbl(.x=mtcars, .f=function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  head()
```

- the "twiddle" uses a twiddle `~` to set a formula
- can use `.x` to reference the input `map(.x = ..., .f = )`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
map_dbl(.x=mtcars,  .f=~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- can be simplified further as
```{r}
map_dbl(.x=mtcars, .f=mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

- what happens when we try a handful of variants of the task at hand?  (how many unique values are there for each variable?)

Note that `.x` is the **name** of the first argument in `map()` (`.f` is the name of the second argument).

```{r}
#| error: true
# the task
map_dbl(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
map_dbl(mtcars, function(unicorn) length(unique(unicorn)))
map_dbl(mtcars, ~length(unique(.x)))
map_dbl(mtcars, ~length(unique(..1)))
map_dbl(mtcars, ~length(unique(.)))

# not the task
map_dbl(mtcars, length)
map_dbl(mtcars, length(unique))
map_dbl(mtcars, 1)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
rm(x)
```

```{r}
#| error: true
#error
map_dbl(mtcars, length(unique()))
map_dbl(mtcars, ~length(unique(x)))
```


## Modify {-}

Sometimes we might want the output to be the same as the input, then in that case we can use the modify function rather than map

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x=1:3,y=6:4)

map(df, .f=~.x*3)

modify(.x=df,.f=~.x*3)
```

Note that `modify()` always returns the same type of output (which is not necessarily true with `map()`).  Additionally, `modify()` does not actually change the value of `df`.

```{r}
df
```


## `purrr` style

```{r}
mtcars |> 
  map(head, 20) |> # pull first 20 of each column
  map_dbl(mean) |> # mean of each vector
  head()
```

An example from `tidytuesday`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

tt <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2020-06-30")

# filter data & exclude columns with lost of nulls
list_df <- 
  map(
    .x = tt[1:3], 
    .f = 
      ~ .x |> 
      filter(issue <= 152 | issue > 200) |> 
      mutate(timeframe = ifelse(issue <= 152, "first 5 years", "last 5 years")) |> 
      select_if(~mean(is.na(.x)) < 0.2) 
  )


# write to global environment
iwalk(
  .x = list_df,
  .f = ~ assign(x = .y, value = .x, envir = globalenv())
)
```

## `map_*()` variants 

There are many variants

![](images/map_variants.png)


## `map2_*()` {-}

- raise each value `.x` by 2

```{r}
map_dbl(
  .x = 1:5, 
  .f = function(x) x ^ 2
)
```

- raise each value `.x` by another value `.y`

```{r}
map2_dbl(
  .x = 1:5, 
  .y = 2:6, 
  .f = ~ (.x ^ .y)
)
```


## The benefit of using the map over apply family of function {-}
- It is written in C
- It preserves names
- We always know the return value type
- We can apply the function for multiple input values
- We can pass additional arguments into the function


## `walk()` {-}


- We use `walk()` when we want to call a function for it side effect(s) rather than its return value, like generating plots, `write.csv()`, or `ggsave()`. If you don't want a return value, `map()` will print more info than you may want.


```{r}
map(1:3, ~cat(.x, "\n"))
```

- for these cases, use `walk()` instead
```{r}
walk(1:3, ~cat(.x, "\n"))
```

`cat()` does have a result, it's just usually returned invisibly.

```{r}
cat("hello")

(cat("hello"))
```


We can use `pwalk()` to save a list of plot to disk.  Note that the "p" in `pwalk()` means that we have more than 1 (or 2) variables to pipe into the function.  Also note that the name of the first argument in all of the "p" functions is now `.l` (instead of `.x`).

```{r}
plots <- mtcars |>  
  split(mtcars$cyl) |>  
  map(~ggplot(.x, aes(mpg,wt)) +
        geom_point())

paths <- stringr::str_c(names(plots), '.png')

pwalk(.l = list(paths,plots), .f = ggsave, path = tempdir())
pmap(.l = list(paths,plots), .f = ggsave, path = tempdir())
  
```

- walk, walk2 and pwalk all invisibly return .x the first argument. This makes them suitable for use in the middle of pipelines.

- note: I don't think that it is "`.x`" (or "`.l`") that they are returning invisibly.  But I'm not sure what it is.  Hadley says:

> purrr provides the walk family of functions that ignore the return values of the `.f` and instead return `.x` invisibly.

But not in the first `cat()` example, it is the `NULL` values that get returned invisibly (those aren't the same as `.x`).

## `imap()` {-}

- `imap()` is like `map2()`except that `.y` is derived from `names(.x)` if named or `seq_along(.x)` if not.

- These two produce the same result

```{r}
imap_chr(.x = mtcars, 
         .f = ~ paste(.y, "has a mean of", round(mean(.x), 1))) |> 
head()

map2_chr(.x = mtcars, 
         .y = names(mtcars),
         .f = ~ paste(.y, "has a mean of", round(mean(.x), 1))) |> 
head()
```


## `pmap()` {-}

- you can pass a named list or dataframe as arguments to a function

- for example `runif()` has the parameters `n`, `min` and `max`

```{r}
params <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ n, ~ min, ~ max,
   1L,     1,    10,
   2L,    10,   100,
   3L,   100,  1000
)

pmap(params, runif)
```

- could also be

```{r}
list(
  n = 1:3, 
  min = 10 ^ (0:2), 
  max = 10 ^ (1:3)
) |> 
pmap(runif)
```

- I like to use `expand_grid()` when I want all possible parameter combinations.

```{r}
expand_grid(n = 1:3,
            min = 10 ^ (0:1),
            max = 10 ^ (1:2))

expand_grid(n = 1:3,
            min = 10 ^ (0:1),
            max = 10 ^ (1:2)) |> 
pmap(runif)
```



## `reduce()` family

The `reduce()` function is a powerful functional that allows you to abstract away from a sequence of functions that are applied in a fixed direction.

`reduce()` takes a vector as its first argument, a function as its second argument, and an optional `.init` argument last.  It will then apply the function repeatedly to the vector until there is only a single element left.

(Hint: start at the top of the image and read down.)

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = 'images/reduce-init.png')
```


Let me really quickly demonstrate `reduce()` in action.

Say you wanted to add up the numbers 1 through 5 using only the plus operator `+`. You could do something like:

```{r}
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

```

Which is the same as:

```{r}
reduce(1:5, `+`)
```

And if you want the start value to be something that is not the first argument of the vector, pass that value to the .init argument:

```{r}

identical(
  0.5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5,
  reduce(1:5, `+`, .init = 0.5)
)

```

## ggplot2 example with reduce {-}

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + 
  geom_point(size = 8, alpha = .5, color = "yellow") +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .5, color = "red") +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5, color = "blue")

```

Let us use the `reduce()` function.  Note that `reduce2()` takes two arguments, but the first value (`..1`) is given by the `.init` value.

```{r}
reduce2(
  c(8, 4, 2),
  c("yellow", "red", "blue"),
  ~ ..1 + geom_point(size = ..2, alpha = .5, color = ..3),
  .init = ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))
)

```

```{r}
df <- list(age=tibble(name='john',age=30),
    sex=tibble(name=c('john','mary'),sex=c('M','F'),
    trt=tibble(name='Mary',treatment='A')))

df

df |> reduce(.f = full_join)

reduce(.x = df,.f = full_join)
```

- to see all intermediate steps, use **accumulate()**

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
accumulate(1:5, `+`)
```

```{r}
accumulate2(
  c(8, 4, 2),
  c("yellow", "red", "blue"),
  ~ ..1 + geom_point(size = ..2, alpha = .5, color = ..3),
  .init = ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))
)
```


## `map_df*()` variants {-}

- `map_dfr()` = row bind the results

- `map_dfc()` = column bind the results

- Note that `map_dfr()` has been superseded by `map() |> list_rbind()` and `map_dfc()` has been superseded by `map() |> list_cbind()`

```{r}
col_stats <- function(n) {
  head(mtcars, n) |> 
    summarise_all(mean) |> 
    mutate_all(floor) |> 
    mutate(n = paste("N =", n))
}

map((1:2) * 10, col_stats)

map_dfr((1:2) * 10, col_stats)

map((1:2) * 10, col_stats) |> list_rbind()
```

---

## `pluck()` {-}

- `pluck()` will pull a single element from a list

I like the example from the book because the starting object is not particularly easy to work with (as many JSON objects might not be).

```{r}
my_list <- list(
  list(-1, x = 1, y = c(2), z = "a"),
  list(-2, x = 4, y = c(5, 6), z = "b"),
  list(-3, x = 8, y = c(9, 10, 11))
)
my_list
```

Notice that the "first element" means something different in standard `pluck()` versus `map`ped `pluck()`.

```{r}
pluck(my_list, 1)

map(my_list, pluck, 1)

map_dbl(my_list, pluck, 1)
```

The `map()` functions also have shortcuts for extracting elements from vectors (powered by `purrr::pluck()`).  Note that `map(my_list, 3)` is a shortcut for `map(my_list, pluck, 3)`.

```{r}
#| error: true

# Select by name
map_dbl(my_list, "x")

# Or by position
map_dbl(my_list, 1)

# Or by both
map_dbl(my_list, list("y", 1))

# You'll get an error if you try to retrieve an inside item that doesn't have 
# a consistent format and you want a numeric output
map_dbl(my_list, list("y"))


# You'll get an error if a component doesn't exist:
map_chr(my_list, "z")
#> Error: Result 3 must be a single string, not NULL of length 0

# Unless you supply a .default value
map_chr(my_list, "z", .default = NA)
#> [1] "a" "b" NA
```


## Not covered: `flatten()` {-}

- `flatten()` will turn a list of lists into a simpler vector.

```{r}
my_list <-
  list(
    a = 1:3,
    b = list(1:3)
  )

my_list

map_if(my_list, is.list, pluck)
  
map_if(my_list, is.list, flatten_int)

map_if(my_list, is.list, flatten_int) |> 
  flatten_int()
```

## Dealing with Failures {-}

## Safely {-}

`safely()` is an adverb.  It takes a function (a verb) and returns a modified version. In this case, the modified function will never throw an error. Instead it always returns a list with two elements.

- `result` is the original result. If there is an error this will be NULL

- `error` is an error object. If the operation was successful the "`error`" will be NULL.

```{r}
A <- list(1, 10, "a")

map(.x = A, .f = safely(log))
  
```

## Possibly {-}

`possibly()` always succeeds. It is simpler than `safely()`, because you can give it a default value to return when there is an error.

```{r}
A <- list(1,10,"a")

map_dbl(.x = A, .f = possibly(log, otherwise = NA_real_) )

```
