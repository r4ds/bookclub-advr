# Names and values

**Learning objectives:**

- To be able to understand distinction between an *object* and its *name*
- With this knowledge, to be able write faster code using less memory
- To better understand R's functional programming tools

Using lobstr package here.
```{r}
library(lobstr)
```


### Quiz {-}

##### 1. How do I create a new column called `3` that contains the sum of `1` and `2`? {-}

```{r}
df <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))
names(df) <- c(1, 2)
df
```

```{r}
df$`3` <- df$`1` + df$`2`
df
```

**What makes these names challenging?**

> You need to use backticks (`) when the name of an object doesn't start with a 
> a character or '.' [or . followed by a number] (non-syntactic names).

##### 2. How much memory does `y` occupy? {-}

```{r}
x <- runif(1e6)
y <- list(x, x, x)
```

Need to use the lobstr package:
```{r}
lobstr::obj_size(y)
```

> Note that if you look in the RStudio Environment or use R base `object.size()`
> you actually get a value of 24 MB

```{r}
object.size(y)
```

##### 3. On which line does `a` get copied in the following example? {-}
```{r}
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
b <- a
b[[1]] <- 10
```

> Not until `b` is modified, the third line

## Binding basics {-}

- Create values and *bind* a name to them
- Names have values (rather than values have names)
- Multiple names can refer to the same values
- We can look at an object's address to keep track of the values independent of their names

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x
obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(y)
```


### Exercises {-}

##### 1. Explain the relationships {-}
```{r}
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```

> `a` `b` and `c` are all names that refer to the first value `1:10`
> 
> `d` is a name that refers to the *second* value of `1:10`.


##### 2. Do the following all point to the same underlying function object? hint: `lobstr::obj_addr()` {-}
```{r}
obj_addr(mean)
obj_addr(base::mean)
obj_addr(get("mean"))
obj_addr(evalq(mean))
obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))
```

> Yes!

## Copy-on-modify {-}

- If you modify a value bound to multiple names, it is 'copy-on-modify'
- If you modify a value bound to a single name, it is 'modify-in-place'
- Use `tracemem()` to see when a name's value changes

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")
```

```{r}
y <- x
y[[3]] <- 4L  # Changes (copy-on-modify)
y[[3]] <- 5L  # Doesn't change (modify-in-place)
```

Turn off `tracemem()` with `untracemem()`

> Can also use `ref(x)` to get the address of the value bound to a given name


## Functions {-}

- Copying also applies within functions
- If you copy (but don't modify) `x` within `f()`, no copy is made

```{r}
f <- function(a) {
  a
}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
z <- f(x) # No change in value

ref(x)
ref(z)
```

## Lists {-}

- A list overall, has it's own reference (id)
- List *elements* also each point to other values
- List doesn't store the value, it *stores a reference to the value*
- As of R 3.1.0, modifying lists creates a *shallow copy*
    - References (bindings) are copied, but *values are not*

```{r}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
l2 <- l1
l2[[3]] <- 4
```

- We can use `ref()` to see how they compare
  - See how the list reference is different
  - But first two items in each list are the same

```{r}
ref(l1, l2)
```

![](images/02-l-modify-2.png){width=50%}

## Data Frames {-}

- Data frames are lists of vectors
- So copying and modifying a column *only affects that column*
- **BUT** if you modify a *row*, every column must be copied

```{r}
d1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 6), y = c(2, 4, 3))
d2 <- d1
d3 <- d1
```

Only the modified column changes
```{r}
d2[, 2] <- d2[, 2] * 2
ref(d1, d2)
```

All columns change
```{r}
d3[1, ] <- d3[1, ] * 3
ref(d1, d3)
```

## Character vectors {-}

- R has a **global string pool**
- Elements of character vectors point to unique strings in the pool

```{r}
x <- c("a", "a", "abc", "d")
```

## Exercises {-}

##### 1. Why is `tracemem(1:10)` not useful? {-}

> Because it tries to trace a value that is not bound to a name

##### 2. Why are there two copies? {-}
```{r}
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
tracemem(x)
x[[3]] <- 4
```

> Because we convert an *integer* vector (using 1L, etc.) to a *double* vector (using just 4)- 

##### 3. What is the relationships among these objects? {-}

```{r}
a <- 1:10      
b <- list(a, a)
c <- list(b, a, 1:10) # 
```

a <- obj 1    
b <- obj 1, obj 1    
c <- b(obj 1, obj 1), obj 1, 1:10    

```{r}
ref(c)
```


##### 4. What happens here? {-}
```{r}
x <- list(1:10)
x[[2]] <- x
```

- `x` is a list
- `x[[2]] <- x` creates a new list, which in turn contains a reference to the 
  original list
- `x` is no longer bound to `list(1:10)`

```{r}
ref(x)
```

## Object Size {-}

- Use `lobstr::obj_size()` 
- Lists may be smaller than expected because of referencing the same value
- Strings may be smaller than expected because using global string pool
- Difficult to predict how big something will be
  - Can only add sizes together if they share no references in common

### Alternative Representation {-}
- As of R 3.5.0 - ALTREP
- Represent some vectors compactly
    - e.g., 1:1000 - not 10,000 values, just 1 and 1,000

### Exercises {-}

##### 1. Why are the sizes so different? {-}

```{r}
y <- rep(list(runif(1e4)), 100)

object.size(y) # ~8000 kB
obj_size(y)    # ~80   kB
```

> From `?object.size()`: 
> 
> "This function merely provides a rough indication: it should be reasonably accurate for atomic vectors, but **does not detect if elements of a list are shared**, for example.

##### 2. Why is the size misleading? {-}

```{r}
funs <- list(mean, sd, var)
obj_size(funs)
```

> Because they reference functions from base and stats, which are always available.
> Why bother looking at the size? What use is that?

##### 3. Predict the sizes {-}

```{r}
a <- runif(1e6) # 8 MB
obj_size(a)
```


```{r}
b <- list(a, a)
```

- There is one value ~8MB
- `a` and `b[[1]]` and `b[[2]]` all point to the same value.

```{r}
obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)
```


```{r}
b[[1]][[1]] <- 10
```
- Now there are two values ~8MB each (16MB total)
- `a` and `b[[2]]` point to the same value (8MB)
- `b[[1]]` is new (8MB) because the first element (`b[[1]][[1]]`) has been changed

```{r}
obj_size(b)     # 16 MB (two values, two element references)
obj_size(a, b)  # 16 MB (a & b[[2]] point to the same value)
```


```{r}
b[[2]][[1]] <- 10
```
- Finally, now there are three values ~8MB each (24MB total)
- Although `b[[1]]` and `b[[2]]` have the same contents, 
  they are not references to the same object.

```{r}
obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)
```


## Modify-in-place {-}

- Modifying usually creates a copy except for
    - Objects with a single binding (performance optimization)
    - Environments (special)

### Objects with a single binding {-}

- Hard to know if copy will occur
- If you have 2+ bindings and remove them, R can't follow how many are removed (so will always think there are more than one)
- May make a copy even if there's only one binding left
- Using a function makes a reference to it **unless it's a function based on C**
- Best to use `tracemem()` to check rather than guess.


#### Example - lists vs. data frames in for loop {-}

**Setup**  

Create the data to modify
```{r}
x <- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 5))
medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))
```


**Data frame - Copied every time!**
```{r}
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")
for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
untracemem(x)
```

**List (uses internal C code) - Copied once!**
```{r}
y <- as.list(x)

cat(tracemem(y), "\n")
for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  y[[i]] <- y[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
untracemem(y)
```

#### Benchmark this (Exercise #2) {-}

**First wrap in a function**
```{r}
med <- function(d, medians) {
  for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
    d[[i]] <- d[[i]] - medians[[i]]
  }
}
```

**Try with 5 columns**
```{r}
x <- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 5))
medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))
y <- as.list(x)

bench::mark(
  "data.frame" = med(x, medians),
  "list" = med(y, medians)
)
```

**Try with 20 columns**
```{r}
x <- data.frame(matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), ncol = 20))
medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))
y <- as.list(x)

bench::mark(
  "data.frame" = med(x, medians),
  "list" = med(y, medians)
)
```

**WOW!**


### Environmments {-}
- Always modified in place (**reference semantics**)
- Interesting because if you modify the environment, all existing bindings have the same reference
- If two names point to the same environment, and you update one, you update both!

```{r}
e1 <- rlang::env(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
e2 <- e1
e1$c <- 4
e2$c
```

- This means that environments can contain themselves (!)

### Exercises {-}

##### 1. Why isn't this circular? {-}
```{r}
x <- list()
x[[1]] <- x
```

> Because the binding to the list() object moves from `x` in the first line to `x[[1]]` in the second.

##### 2. (see "Objects with a single binding") {-}

##### 3. What happens if you attempt to use tracemem() on an environment? {-}

```{r}
#| error: true
e1 <- rlang::env(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
tracemem(e1)
```

> Because environments always modified in place, there's no point in tracing them


## Unbinding and the garbage collector {-}

- If you delete the 'name' bound to an object, the object still exists
- R runs a "garbage collector" (GC) to remove these objects when it needs more memory
- "Looking from the outside, it’s basically impossible to predict when the GC will run. In fact, you shouldn’t even try."
- If you want to know when it runs, use `gcinfo(TRUE)` to get a message printed
- You can force GC with `gc()` but you never need to to use more memory *within* R
- Only reason to do so is to free memory for other system software, or, to get the
message printed about how much memory is being used

```{r}
gc()
mem_used()
```

- These numbers will **not** be what you OS tells you because, 
  1. It includes objects created by R, but not R interpreter
  2. R and OS are lazy and don't reclaim/release memory until it's needed
  3. R counts memory from objects, but there are gaps due to those that are deleted -> 
  *memory fragmentation* [less memory actually available they you might think]

00:51:54	Trevin:	parquet?
00:53:00	Arthur Shaw:	We may all be right. {arrow} looks to deal with feather and parquet files: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/
01:00:04	Arthur Shaw:	Some questions for future meetings. (1) I find Ryan's use of slides hugely effective in conveying information. Would it be OK if future sessions (optionally) used slides? If so, should/could we commit slides to some folder on the repo? (2) I think reusing the images from Hadley's books really helps understanding and discussion. Is that OK to do? Here I'm thinking about copyright concerns. (If possible, I would rather not redraw variants of Hadley's images.)
01:01:35	Federica Gazzelloni:	It's all ok, you can use past presentation, you don't need to push them to the repo, you can use the images from the book
01:07:19	Federica Gazzelloni:	Can I use: gc(reset = TRUE) safely?
