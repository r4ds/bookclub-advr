# Encapsulation and mutability are the main differentiators of R6 classes 

## Learning objectives:

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ids)
```

- Create R6 classes
- Assign methods and fields in R6 classes
- Compare public and private R6 fields
- Implement R6 finalizers

## Introducing R6 

![](images/14-r6-logo.png)

* R6 classes are not built into base.
  * It is a separate [package](https://r6.r-lib.org/).
  * You have to install and attach to use.
  * If R6 objects are used in a package, it needs to be specified as a dependency in the `DESCRIPTION` file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("R6")
```

```{r}
library(R6)
```

* R6 classes have two special properties:
  1. Uses an encapsulated OOP paradigm.
     * Methods belong to objects, not generics.
     * They follow the form `object$method()` for calling fields and methods.
  2. R6 objects are mutable.
     * Modified in place.
     * They follow reference semantics.
* R6 is similar to OOP in other languages.
* However, its use can lead ton non-idiomatic R code.
  * Tradeoffs - follows an OOP paradigm but sacrafice what users are use to. 
  * [Microsoft365R](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft365R).

## Constructing an R6 class, the basics

* Really simple to do, just use the `R6::R6Class()` function.

```{r}
Accumulator <- R6Class("Accumulator", list(
  sum = 0,
  add = function(x = 1) {
    self$sum <- self$sum + x
    invisible(self)
  }
))
```

* Two important arguments:
  1. `classname` - A string used to name the class (not needed but suggested)
  2. `public` - A list of methods (functions) and fields (anything else)
* Suggested style conventions to follow:
  * Class name should follow `UpperCamelCase`.
  * Methods and fields should use `snake_case`.
  * Always assign the result of a `R6Class()` into a variable with the same name as the class.
* You can use `self$` to access methods and fields of the current object.

## Constructing an R6 object

* Just use `$new()`

```{r}
x <- Accumulator$new()
```

```{r}
x$add(4)
x$sum
```

## R6 objects and method chaining

* All side-effect R6 methods should return `self` invisibly.
* This allows for method chaining.

```{r eval=FALSE}
x$add(10)$add(10)$sum
# [1] 24
```

* To improve readability:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Method chaining
x$
  add(10)$
  add(10)$
  sum
# [1] 44
```

## R6 useful methods

* `$print()` - Modifies the default printing method.
  * `$print()` should always return `invisible(self)`.
* `$initialize()` - Overides the default behaviour of `$new()`.
  * Also provides a space to validate inputs.

## Constructing a bank account class

```{r}
BankAccount <- R6Class("BankAccount", list(
  owner = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  balance = 0,
  initialize = function(owner, type) {
    stopifnot(is.character(owner), length(owner) == 1)
    stopifnot(is.character(type), length(type) == 1)
  },
  deposit = function(amount) {
    self$balance <- self$balance + amount
    invisible(self)
  },
  withdraw = function(amount) {
    self$balance <- self$balance - amount
    invisible(self)
  }
))
```

## Simple transactions

```{r}
collinsavings <- BankAccount$new("Collin", type = "Savings")
collinsavings$deposit(10)
collinsavings
```

```{r}
collinsavings$withdraw(10)
collinsavings
```

## Modifying the `$print()` method 

```{r}
BankAccount <- R6Class("BankAccount", list(
  owner = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  balance = 0,
  initialize = function(owner, type) {
    stopifnot(is.character(owner), length(owner) == 1)
    stopifnot(is.character(type), length(type) == 1)

    self$owner <- owner
    self$type <- type
  },
  deposit = function(amount) {
    self$balance <- self$balance + amount
    invisible(self)
  },
  withdraw = function(amount) {
    self$balance <- self$balance - amount
    invisible(self)
  },
  print = function(...) {
    cat("Account owner: ", self$owner, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("Account type: ", self$type, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("  Balance: ", self$balance, "\n", sep = "")
    invisible(self)
  }
))
```

* Important point: Methods are bound to individual objects.
  * Reference semantics vs. copy-on-modify.

```{r eval=FALSE}
collinsavings

hadleychecking <- BankAccount$new("Hadley", type = "Checking")

hadleychecking
```

## How does this work? 

* [Winston Chang's 2017 useR talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GEFd8rZQgY&list=WL&index=11)

* [R6 objects are just environments with a particular structure.](https://youtu.be/3GEFd8rZQgY?t=759)
 
![](images/14-r6_environment.png)

## Adding methods after class creation

* Use `$set()` to add methods after creation.
* Keep in mind methods added with `$set()` are only available with new objects.

```{r eval=FALSE}
Accumulator <- R6Class("Accumulator")
Accumlator$set("public", "sum", 0)
Accumulator$set("public", "add", function(x = 1) {
  self$sum <- self$sum + x
  invisible(self)
})
```

## Inheritance

* To inherit behaviour from an existing class, provide the class object via the `inherit` argument.
* This example also provides a good example on how to [debug]() an R6 class.

```{r eval=FALSE}
BankAccountOverDraft <- R6Class("BankAccountOverDraft",
  inherit = BankAccount,
  public = list(
    withdraw = function(amount) {
      if ((self$balance - amount) < 0) {
        stop("Overdraft")
      }
      # self$balance() <- self$withdraw()
      self$balance <- self$balance - amount
      invisible(self)
    }
  )
)
```

### Future instances debugging

```{r eval=FALSE}
BankAccountOverDraft$debug("withdraw")
x <- BankAccountOverDraft$new("x", type = "Savings")
x$withdraw(20)

# Turn debugging off
BankAccountOverDraft$undebug("withdraw")
```

### Individual object debugging

* Use the `debug()` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- BankAccountOverDraft$new("x", type = "Savings")
# Turn on debugging
debug(x$withdraw)
x$withdraw(10)

# Turn off debugging
undebug(x$withdraw)
x$withdraw(5)
```

### Test out our debugged class

```{r eval=FALSE}
collinsavings <- BankAccountOverDraft$new("Collin", type = "Savings")
collinsavings
collinsavings$withdraw(10)
collinsavings
collinsavings$deposit(5)
collinsavings
collinsavings$withdraw(5)
```

## Introspection

* Every R6 object has an S3 class that reflects its hierarchy of R6 classes.
* Use the `class()` function to determine class (and all classes it inherits from).

```{r eval=FALSE}
class(collinsavings)
```

* You can also list all methods and fields of an R6 object with `names()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
names(collinsavings)
```

## Controlling access

* R6 provides two other arguments:
  * `private` - create fields and methods only available from within the class.
  * `active` - allows you to use accessor functions to define dynamic or active fields.

## Privacy

* Private fields and methods - elements that can only be accessed from within the class, not from the outside.
* We need to know two things to use private elements:
  1. `private`'s interface is just like `public`'s interface.
     * List of methods (functions) and fields (everything else).
  2. You use `private$` instead of `self$`
     * You cannot access private fields or methods outside of the class.
* Why might you want to keep your methods and fields private?
  * You'll want to be clear what is ok for others to access, especially if you have a complex system of classes.
  * It's easier to refactor private fields and methods, as you know others are not relying on it.

## Active fields

* Active fields allow you to define components that look like fields from the outside, but are defined with functions, like methods.
* Implemented using active bindings.
* Each active binding is a function that takes a single argument `value`.
* Great when used in conjunction with private fields.
  * This allows for additional checks.
  * For example, we can use them to make a read-only field and to validate inputs.

## Adding a read-only bank account number

```{r eval=FALSE}
BankAccount <- R6Class("BankAccount", public = list(
  owner = NULL,
  type = NULL,
  balance = 0,
  initialize = function(owner, type, acct_num = NULL) {
    private$acct_num <- acct_num
    self$owner <- owner
    self$type <- type
  },
  deposit = function(amount) {
    self$balance <- self$balance + amount
    invisible(self)
  },
  withdraw = function(amount) {
    self$balance <- self$balance - amount
    invisible(self)
  },
  print = function(...) {
    cat("Account owner: ", self$owner, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("Account type: ", self$type, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("Account #: ", private$acct_num, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("  Balance: ", self$balance, "\n", sep = "")
    invisible(self)
  }
  ),
  private = list(
    acct_num = NULL
  ),
  active = list(
    create_acct_num = function(value) {
      if (is.null(private$acct_num)) {
        private$acct_num <- ids::uuid()
      } else {
        stop("`$acct_num` already assigned")
      }
    }
  )
)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
collinsavings <- BankAccount$new("Collin", type = "Savings")
collinsavings$create_acct_num
# Stops because account number is assigned
collinsavings$create_acct_num()
collinsavings$print()
```

## How does an active field work?

* Not sold on this, as I don't know if `active` gets its own environment. 
  * Any ideas?

![](images/14-r6_active_field.png)

## Reference semantics

* Big difference to note about R6 objects in relation to other objects:
  * R6 objects have reference semantics.
* The primary consequence of reference semantics is that objects are not copied when modified.
* If you want to copy an R6 object, you need to use `$clone`.
* There are some other less obvious consequences:
  * It's harder to reason about code that uses R6 objects, as you need more context.
  * Think about when an R6 object is deleted, you can use `$finalize()` to clean up after yourself.
  * If one of the fields is an R6 object, you must create it inside `$initialize()`, not `R6Class()`

## R6 makes it harder to reason about code

* Reference semantics makes code harder to reason about.

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- list(a = 1)
y <- list(b = 2)

# Here we know the final line only modifies z
z <- f(x, y)

# vs.

x <- List$new(a = 1)
y <- List$new(b = 2)

# If x or y is a method, we don't know if it modifies
# something other than z. Is this a limitation of
# abstraction?
z <- f(x, y)
```

* I understand the basics, but not necessarily the tradeoffs.
  * Anyone care to fill me in?
  * Is this a limitation of abstraction?

## Better sense of what's going on by looking at a finalizer

* Since R6 objects are not copied-on-modified, so they are only deleted once.
* We can use this characteristic to complement our `$initialize()` with a `$finalize()` method.
  * i.e., to clean up after we delete an R6 object.
  * This could be a way to close a database connection.

```{r eval=FALSE}
TemporaryFile <- R6Class("TemporaryFile", list(
  path = NULL,
  initialize = function() {
    self$path <- tempfile()
  },
  finalize = function() {
    message("Cleaning up ", self$path)
    unlink(self$path)
  }
))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
tf <- TemporaryFile$new()
# The finalizer will clean up, once the R6 object is deleted.
rm(tf)
```

## Consequences of R6 fields

* If you use an R6 class as the default value of a field, it will be shared across all instances of the object.

```{r eval=FALSE}
TemporaryDatabase <- R6Class("TemporaryDatabase", list(
  con = NULL,
  file = TemporaryFile$new(),
  initialize = function() {
    self$con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path = file$path)
  },
  finalize = function() {
    DBI::dbDisconnect(self$con)
  }
))

db_a <- TemporaryDatabase$new()
db_b <- TemporaryDatabase$new()

db_a$file$path == db_b$file$path
#> [1] TRUE
```

* To fix this, we need to move the class method call to `$intialize()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
TemporaryDatabase <- R6Class("TemporaryDatabase", list(
  con = NULL,
  file = NULL,
  initialize = function() {
    self$file <- TemporaryFile$new()
    self$con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path = file$path)
  },
  finalize = function() {
    DBI::dbDisconnect(self$con)
  }
))

db_a <- TemporaryDatabase$new()
db_b <- TemporaryDatabase$new()

db_a$file$path == db_b$file$path
#> [1] FALSE
```

## Why use R6?

* Book mentions R6 is similar to the built-in reference classes.
* Then why use R6?
* R6 is simpler. 
  * RC requires you to understand S4.
* [Comprehensive documentation](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html).
* Simpler mechanisms for cross-package subclassing, which just works.
* R6 separates public and private fields in separate environments, RC stacks everything in the same environment. 
* [R6 is faster](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Performance.html).
* RC is tied to R, so any bug fixes need a newer version of R.
  * This is especially important if you're writing packages that need to work with multiple R versions.
* R6 and RC are similar, so if you need RC, it will only require a small amount of additional effort to learn RC.
