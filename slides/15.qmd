## Learning objectives

- Identify the main components of S4 objects, including the new **slot** component
- Learn best practices for creating new S4 classes and creating/modifying/accessing their objects
- "Understand" multiple inheritance, multiple dispatch, and appreciate their risks and complexity 

## Not learning objectives

- How to most effectively deploy S4
  - No single reference.
  - Existing references often conflict.

# Basics

[Section 15.2 Basics]: #

## All functions related to S4 live in the `{methods}` package

```{r}
#| eval: true
library(methods)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Best practice to explicitly call `library(methods)` since it is not loaded by
default in non-interactive environments (i.e. `Rscript`)
:::

## `setClass()` defines an S4 class and its slots; `new()` creates a new object

```{r}
setClass("Person", 
  slots = c(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  )
)

john <- new("Person", name = "John Smith", age = NA_real_)
```

## Access slots with `@` or `slot()`, but don't use it outside of your own methods

```{r}
john@name

slot(john, "age")
```

## Supply *accessor* functions for others to use with your class

```{r}
#| output: false
setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))

setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  x
})
```
  
```{r}
age(john) <- 50
age(john)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
Look for accessor functions when working with classes maintained by others
:::

## `{sloop}` can help you identify S4 objects and generics

```{r}
sloop::otype(john)
sloop::ftype(age)
```

[Section 15.3 Classes]: #

# Classes

## `setClass()` has 4 arguments you should use. The rest should be ignored. {transition="none-out"}

- `Class` sets the class name.
  - By convention use `UpperCamelCase`
- `slots` sets the available slots (fields) using a named character vector of classes
- `prototype` list default values for each slot
  - Always provide `prototype`, even though its optional
- `contains` specifies classes to inherit slots from


## `setClass()` has 4 arguments you should use. The rest should be ignored. {transition="none"}

```{r}
setClass("Person", 
  slots = c(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  ), 
  prototype = list(
    name = NA_character_,
    age = NA_real_
  )
)

me <- new("Person", name = "Hadley")
str(me)
```

## `setClass()` has 4 arguments you should use. The rest should be ignored.{transition="none"}

```{r}
setClass("Employee", 
  contains = "Person", 
  slots = c(
    boss = "Person"
  ),
  prototype = list(
    boss = new("Person")
  )
)

str(new("Employee"))
```

## `setClass()` has 4 arguments you should use. The rest should be ignored. {transition="none-in"}

:::{.callout-caution}
Use `setClass()` with care. It’s possible to create invalid objects if you redefine a class after already having instantiated an object.
:::

```{r}
#| error: true
setClass("A", slots = c(x = "numeric"))
a <- new("A", x = 10)

setClass("A", slots = c(a_different_slot = "numeric"))
a
```


## Use `is()` to determine an objects classes or test for a specific class

```{r}
is(new("Person"))
is(new("Employee"))
is(john, "Person")
```

## User-facing classes should be paired with a **helper** function to create new objects

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
Person <- function(name, age = NA) {
  age <- as.double(age)
  
  new("Person", name = name, age = age)
}

Person("Hadley")
```
:::
::: {.column}
- Use the same name as the class.
- Craft user interface with carefully chosen defaults and useful conversions.
- Craft error messages tailored towards an end-user.
- Finish by calling `methods::new()`.
:::
::::

## Create a **validator** to enforce rules around slot values

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
- S4 automatically checks slots for the correct class
- Use `setValidity()` to enforce more complex rules
- Check validity with `validObject()`
:::
:::{.column width=60%}
```{r}
#| output: false
setValidity("Person", function(object) {
  if (length(object@name) != length(object@age)) {
    "@name and @age must be same length"
  } else {
    TRUE
  }
})
```
```{r}
#| error: true
Person("Hadley", age = c(30, 37))
validObject(john)
```
:::
::::

:::{.callout-caution}
Validity is only called automatically by `new()`. Slots can be modified with invalid values.
:::

[Section 15.4 Generics & Methods]: #

# Generics & Methods

## Create an S4 generic with `setGeneric()` and `standardGeneric()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) standardGeneric("myGeneric"))
```

- By convention use `lowerCamelCase`

:::{.callout-caution}
Using `{}` in `function()` definition triggers a expensive special case and should be avoided.
```{r}
#| eval: false
# Don't do this!
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
  standardGeneric("myGeneric")
})
```
:::

## Use the `signature` argument of `setGeneric()` to help control dispatch

```{r}
#| eval: false
setGeneric("myGeneric", 
  function(x, ..., verbose = TRUE) standardGeneric("myGeneric"),
  signature = "x"
)
```

- Without `signature` all arguments (except for `...`) are considered during
  dispatch
- Helpful for adding arguments like `verbose = TRUE` and `quiet = FALSE`

## Define methods using `setMethod()`

- Only use the following 3 arguments (never use others)
  - `f`: the name of the generic
  - `signature`: class or classes to use for dispatch
  - `definition`: the function definition for the method
  
```{r}
#| eval: false
setMethod("myGeneric", "Person", function(x) {
  # method implementation
})
```



## The `show()` method controls how the object is printed.

- It is the most commonly defined S4 method

```{r}
# Determine arguments required
args(getGeneric("show"))

setMethod("show", "Person", function(object) {
  cat(is(object)[[1]], "\n",
      "  Name: ", object@name, "\n",
      "  Age:  ", object@age, "\n",
      sep = ""
  )
})
john
```

## All user-accessible slots should be accompanied by a pair of *accessors* {transition="none-out"}

One for reading...

```{r}
setGeneric("name", function(x) standardGeneric("name"))
setMethod("name", "Person", function(x) x@name)

name(john)
```

## All user-accessible slots should be accompanied by a pair of *accessors* {transition="none-in"}

...and one for writing.

```{r}
#| error: true
setGeneric("name<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("name<-"))
setMethod("name<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@name <- value
  validObject(x)
  x
})

name(john) <- "Jon Smythe"
name(john)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
Always include `validObject()` in the setter function.
:::

## Use `methods()` and `selectMethods()` to investigate available methods for a generic or class

```{r}
methods("age")
methods(class = "Person")
selectMethod("age", "Person")
```

[Section 15.5 Method Dispatch]: #

# Method Dispatch

## S4 dispatch is **complicated**!

- Multiple inheritance, i.e. a class can have multiple parents
- Multiple dispatch, i.e. a generic can use multiple arguments to pick a method.

:::{.callout-tip}
Keep method dispatch as simple as possible by avoiding multiple inheritance, and reserving multiple dispatch only for where it is absolutely necessary.
:::

## It can help to visualize dispatch as a graph

![](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/diagrams/s4/emoji.png)

## Single dispatch is straight forward

![](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/diagrams/s4/single.png)

## Pseudo-classes `ANY` and `MISSING` can help define useful behaviors

- `ANY` matches any class and is always at the end of a method graph

![](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/diagrams/s4/single-any.png)

- `MISSING` matches whenever an argument is missing
  - Useful for functions like `+` and `-`
  
## Multiple inheritance is tricky

![](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/diagrams/s4/multiple.png)

Class with the shortest distance to the specified class gets dispatched.

## Multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguous method dispatch

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
![](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/diagrams/s4/multiple-ambig.png)  
:::
:::{.column}
- Methods of equal distance cause ambiguous method dispatch and generate a warning
- Always resolve ambiguity by providing a more precise method
:::
::::

## Use multiple inheritance with *extreme care*

It is hard to prevent ambiguity, ensure every terminal method has
an implementation, and minimize the number of defined methods.

![Only one of the above calls is free from problems.](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/diagrams/s4/multiple-all.png)  

## Multiple dispatch is less tricky to work with than multiple inheritance

- Fewer terminal class combinations allow you to define a single method and have
default behavior

[Section 15.6 S4 & S3]: #

# Mixing S4 & S3

## S3 must first be registered with `setOldClass()` before inclusion in S4 {transition="none-out"}

Can be as simple as

```{r}
#| eval: false
setOldClass("factor")
```

## S3 must first be registered with `setOldClass()` before inclusion in S4 {transition="none-in"}

But better to specify a full S4 definition

```{r}
#| eval: false
setClass("factor",
  contains = "integer",
  slots = c(
    levels = "character"
  ),
  prototype = structure(
    integer(),
    levels = character()
  )
)
setOldClass("factor", S4Class = "factor")
```

:::{.callout-caution}
These definitions should be provided by the creator of the S3 class. Don't trying building an S4 class on top of an S3 class provided by a package. Instead request that the package maintainer add this call to their package.
:::

## S4 classes receive as special `.Data` slot when inheriting from S3 or base types

```{r}
RangedNumeric <- setClass(
  "RangedNumeric",
  contains = "numeric",
  slots = c(min = "numeric", max = "numeric"),
  prototype = structure(numeric(), min = NA_real_, max = NA_real_)
)
rn <- RangedNumeric(1:10, min = 1, max = 10)
rn@min
rn@.Data
```

## S3 generics are easily converted to S4 generics

```{r}
#| output: false
setGeneric("mean")
```
```{r}
selectMethod("mean", "ANY")
```

:::{.callout-caution}
It is OK to convert an existing S3 generic to S4, but you should avoid converting regular functions to S4 generics

# Exercises {visibility="uncounted"}

[Section 15.2 Exercises]: #

## `lubridate::period()` returns an S4 class. What slots does it have? What class is each slot? What accessors does it provide? {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Objects of the S4 `Period` class have six slots named `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `.Data` (which contains the number of seconds). All slots are of type double. Most fields can be retrieved by an identically named accessor (e.g. `lubridate::year()` will return the field), use `second()` to get the `.Data` slot.

As a short example, we create a period of 1 second, 2 minutes, 3 hours, 4 days and 5 weeks.

```{r}
example_12345 <- lubridate::period(
  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 
  c("second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week")
)
```

This should add up to a period of 39 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes and 1 second.

```{r}
example_12345
```

When we inspect `example_12345`, we see the fields and infer that the seconds are stored in the `.Data` field.

```{r}
str(example_12345)
```

##  What other ways can you find help for a method? Read `?"?"` and summarise the details. {visibility="uncounted"}

- documentation for a specific method via `ClassName?methodName`.

[Section 15.3 Exercises]: #

## Extend the Person class with fields to match `utils::person()`. Think about what slots you will need, what class each slot should have, and what you’ll need to check in your validity method. {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
The Person class from *Advanced R* contains the slots `name` and `age`. The person class from the `{utils}` package contains the slots `given` (vector of given names), `family`, `role`, `email` and `comment` (see `?utils::person`). 

All slots from `utils::person()` besides `role` must be of type character and length 1. The entries in the `role` slot must match one of the following abbreviations "aut", "com", "cph", "cre", "ctb", "ctr", "dtc", "fnd", "rev", "ths", "trl". Therefore, `role` might be of different length than the other slots and we'll add a corresponding constraint within the validator.

```{r}
# Definition of the Person class
setClass("Person",
  slots = c(
    age = "numeric",
    given = "character",
    family = "character",
    role = "character",
    email = "character",
    comment = "character"
  ),
  prototype = list(
    age = NA_real_,
    given = NA_character_,
    family = NA_character_,
    role = NA_character_,
    email = NA_character_,
    comment = NA_character_
  )
)

# Helper to create instances of the Person class
Person <- function(given, family,
                   age = NA_real_,
                   role = NA_character_,
                   email = NA_character_,

## What happens if you define a new S4 class that doesn’t have any slots?  (Hint: read about virtual classes in `?setClass`.) {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
It depends on the other arguments. If we inherit from another class, we get the same slots. But something interesting happens if we don't inherit from an existing class. We get a virtual class. A virtual class can't be instantiated:

```{r, eval = TRUE, error = TRUE}
setClass("Human")
new("Human")
```

But can be inherited from:

```{r}
setClass("Programmer", contains = "Human")
```
:::

## Imagine you were going to reimplement factors, dates, and data frames in S4. Sketch out the `setClass()` calls that you would use to define the classes. Think about appropriate `slots` and `prototype`. {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
For all these classes we need one slot for the data and one slot per attribute. Keep in mind, that inheritance matters for ordered factors and dates. For data frames, special checks like equal lengths of the underlying list's elements should be done within a validator.

For simplicity we don't introduce an explicit subclass for ordered factors. Instead, we introduce `ordered` as a slot.

```{r}
setClass("Factor",
  slots = c(
    data = "integer",
    levels = "character",
    ordered = "logical"
  ),
  prototype = list(
    data = integer(),
    levels = character(),
    ordered = FALSE
  )
)


new("Factor", data = c(1L, 2L), levels = letters[1:3])
```

The `Date2` class stores its dates as integers, similarly to base R which uses doubles. Dates don't have any other attributes.

```{r}
setClass("Date2",
  slots = list(
    data = "integer"
  ),
  prototype = list(
    data = integer()
  )
)

new("Date2", data = 1L)
```

Our `DataFrame` class consists of a list and a slot for `row.names`. Most of the logic (e.g. checking that all elements of the list are a vector, and that they all have the same length) would need to be part of a validator.

```{r}
setClass("DataFrame",
  slots = c(
    data = "list",
    row.names = "character"
  ),
  prototype = list(
    data = list(),
    row.names = character(0)
  )
)

new("DataFrame", data = list(a = 1, b = 2))
```

[Section 15.4 Exercises]: #

## Add `age()` accessors for the `Person` class. {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
We implement the accessors via an `age()` generic, with a method for the `Person` class and a corresponding replacement function `age<-`:

```{r}
setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)

setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@age <- value
  validObject(x)
  x
})
```
:::

## In the definition of the generic, why is it necessary to repeat the name of the generic twice? {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
 Within `setGeneric()` the `name` (1st argument) is needed as the name of the generic. Then, the name also explicitly incorporates method dispatch via `standardGeneric()` within the generic's body (`def` parameter of `setGeneric()`). This behaviour is similar to `UseMethod()` in S3.
:::

## Why does the `show()` method defined in section [15.4.3](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html#show-method) use `is(object)[[1]]`? (Hint: try printing the employee subclass.) {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
`is(object)` returns the class of the object. `is(object)` also contains the superclass, for subclasses like `Employee`. In order to always return the most specific class (the subclass), `show()` returns the first element of `is(object)`.
:::

## What happens if you define a method with different argument names to the generic? {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
It depends. We first create the object `hadley` of class `Person`:

```{r}
.Person <- setClass(
  "Person",
  slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric")
)

hadley <- .Person(name = "Hadley")
hadley
```

Now let's see which arguments can be supplied to the `show()` generic.

```{r}
formals("show")
```

Usually, we would use this argument when defining a new method.

```{r}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(object) {
  cat(object@name, "creates hard exercises")
})

hadley
```

When we supply another name as a first element of our method (e.g. `x` instead of `object`), this element will be matched to the correct `object` argument and we receive a warning. Our method will work, though:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(x) {
  cat(x@name, "creates hard exercises")
})

hadley
```

If we add more arguments to our method than our generic can handle, we will get an error.

```{r, eval = TRUE, error = TRUE}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(x, y) {
  cat(x@name, "is", x@age, "years old")
})
```

If we do this with arguments added to the correctly written `object` argument, we will receive an informative error message. It states that we could add other argument names for generics, which can take the `...` argument.

```{r, eval = TRUE, error = TRUE}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(object, y) {
  cat(object@name, "is", object@age, "years old")
})
```

[Section 15.6 Exercises]: #

##  What would a full `setOldClass()` definition look like for an ordered factor (i.e. add `slots` and `prototype` to the definition above)? {visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
The purpose of `setOldClass()` lies in registering an S3 class as a "formally defined class", so that it can be used within the S4 object-oriented programming system. When using it, we may provide the argument `S4Class`, which will inherit the slots and their default values (prototype) to the registered class.

Let's build an S4 `OrderedFactor` on top of the S3 factor in such a way.

```{r}
setOldClass("factor")    # use build-in definition for brevity

OrderedFactor <- setClass(
  "OrderedFactor",
  contains = "factor",   # inherit from registered S3 class
  slots = c(
    levels = "character",
    ordered = "logical"  # add logical order slot
  ),
  prototype = structure(
    integer(),
    levels = character(),
    ordered = logical()  # add default value
  )
)
```

We can now register the (S3) ordered-class, while providing an "S4 template". We can also use the S4-class to create new object directly.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
setOldClass("ordered", S4Class = "OrderedFactor")

x <- OrderedFactor(
  c(1L, 2L, 2L),
  levels = c("a", "b", "c"),
  ordered = TRUE
)
str(x)
```

## Define a `length` method for the `Person` class. {visibility="uncounted"}

We keep things simple and will just return `"180cm"` when the `length()` method is called on a `Person` object. The method can be defined either as an S3 or S4 method.

length.Person <- function(x) "180cm"  # S3
setMethod("length", "Person", function(x) "180cm")  # S4
