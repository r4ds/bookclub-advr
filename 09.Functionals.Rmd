# What are functionals {-}

## Introduction {-}

__Functionals__ are functions that take function as input and return a vector as output. Functionals that you probably have used before are: `apply()`, `lapply()` or `tapply()`.


- alternatives to loops

- a functional is better than a `for` loop is better than `while` is better than `repeat`

- don't shoehorn it in if a loop is the easiest answer
- ex: iterating over `eval()`


### Benefits {-}

- encourages function logic to be separated from iteration logic

- can collapse into vectors/data frames easily


## Map

`map()` has two arguments, a vector and a function. It performs the function on each element of the vector and returns a list. We can also pass in some additional argument into the function.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = 'images/9_2_3_map-arg.png')
```

- `purrr::map()` is equivalent to `lapply()`

- returns a list and is the most general

- the length of the input == the length of the output


```{r load,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Atomic vectors {-}


- has 4 variants to return atomic vectors
- `map_chr()`
- `map_dbl()`
- `map_int()`
- `map_lgl()`

```{r}
triple <- function(x) x * 3
map(.x=1:3, .f=triple)

map_dbl(.x=1:3, .f=triple)

map_lgl(.x=c(1, NA, 3), .f=is.na)
```

# Anonymous functions and shortcuts  {-}

Anonymous functions
```{r}
map_dbl(.x=mtcars, .f=function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  head()
```

- the "twiddle" uses a tilda `~` to set a formula
- can use `.x` to reference the input `map(.x = ..., .f = )`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
map_dbl(.x=mtcars,  .f=~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- can be simplified further as
```{r, eval=FALSE}
map_dbl(.x=mtcars, .f=mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## `purrr` style

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  map(head, 20) %>% # pull first 20 of each column
  map_dbl(mean) %>% # mean of each vector
  head()
```

An example from `tidytuesday`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tt <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2020-06-30")

# filter data & exclude columns with lost of nulls
list_df <-
  map(
    .x = tt[1:3],
    .f =
      ~ .x %>%
      filter(issue <= 152 | issue > 200) %>%
      mutate(timeframe = ifelse(issue <= 152, "first 5 years", "last 5 years")) %>%
      select_if(~mean(is.na(.)) < 0.2)
  )

# write to global environment
iwalk(
  .x = list_df,
  .f = ~ assign(x = .y, value = .x, envir = globalenv())
)
```

## `map_*()` variants

There are many variants

![](images/map_variants.png)




# `map2_*()` {-}

- raise each value `.x` by 2

```{r}
map_dbl(
  .x = 1:5,
  .f = function(x) x ^ 2
)
```

- raise each value `.x` by another value `.y`

```{r}
map2_dbl(
  .x = 1:5,
  .y = 2:6,
  .f = ~ (.x ^ .y)
)
```

---

  # `walk()` {-}


  - We use walk when we want to call a function for it side effect rather than it return value, like generating plots, `write.csv()` or `ggsave()`, `map()` will print more info than you may want

```{r}
map(1:3, ~cat(.x, "\n"))
```

- for these cases, use `walk()` instead
```{r}
walk(1:3, ~cat(.x, "\n"))
```


We can use pwalk to save a list of plot to disk
```{r eval=FALSE}
plots <- mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  map(~ggplot(.,aes(mpg,wt))+geom_point())

paths <- stringr::str_c(names(plots),'.png')

pwalk(list(paths,plots),ggsave,path=tempdir())


# I will delete one
temp <- tempfile()

dir.create(temp)

cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)

paths <- file.path(temp, paste0("cyl-", names(cyls), ".csv"))

walk2(cyls, paths, write.csv)

dir(temp)


```


---

  # `imap()` {-}

  - `imap()` is like `map2()`except that `.y` is derived from `names(.x)` if named or `seq_along(.x)` if not

- These two produce the same result

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map2_chr(.x = mtcars, .y = names(mtcars), .f = ~ paste(.y, "has a mean of", round(mean(.x), 1)))
```

```{r}
imap_chr(.x = mtcars, .f = ~ paste(.y, "has a mean of", round(mean(.x), 1))) %>%
  head()

```

---

  # `imap()` {-}

  - When .x isn't named, the index will be used
```{r}
set.seed(1234)

x <- map(1:3, ~ sample(100, 3))

imap_chr(
  .x = x,
  .f = ~ paste("The highest value in set", .y, "is", max(.x))
)
```

---

# `pmap()` {-}

- you can pass a named list or dataframe as arguments to a function

- for example `runif()` has the parameters `n`, `min` and `max`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
params <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ n, ~ min, ~ max,
   1L,     1,    10,
   2L,    10,   100,
   3L,   100,  1000
)

pmap(params, runif)
```

- could also be

```{r}
list(
  n = 1:3,
  min = 10 ^ (0:2),
  max = 10 ^ (1:3)
) %>%
  pmap(runif)
```

## `reduce()` family
The reduce() function is a powerful functional that allows you to abstract away from a sequence of functions that are applied in a fixed direction.
reduce takes a vector as its first argument, a function as its second argument, and an optional .init argument, it will then apply this function repeatedly to a list until there is only a single element left.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = 'images/reduce-init.png')
```


Let me really quickly demonstrate `reduce()` in action.

Say you wanted to add up the numbers 1 through 5, but only using the plus operator +. You could do something like this

```{r}
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

```
Which is the same thing as this:
```{r}
set.seed(1234)

reduce(1:5, `+`)
```

And if you want the start value to be something thatâ€™s not the first argument of the vector, pass that to the .init argument:

```{r}

identical(
  0.5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5,
  reduce(1:5, `+`, .init = 0.5)
)

```
# ggplot2 Example with reduce {-}

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 8, alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5)

```
Let us use the reduce `function`
```{r}
reduce(
  c(8, 4, 2),
  ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y, alpha = .5),
  .init = ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))
)

```

```{r}
df <- list(age=tibble(name='john',age=30),sex=tibble(name=c('john','mary'),sex=c('M','F'),trt=tibble(name='Mary',treatment='A')))


df |> reduce(.f = full_join)

reduce(.x = df,.f = full_join)
```

- to see all intermediate steps, use **accumulate()**
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
accumulate(1:5, `+`)
```


---

# Not covered: `map_df*()` variants {-}

- `map_dfr()` = row bind the results

- `map_dfc()` = column bind the results

```{r}
col_stats <- function(n) {
  head(mtcars, n) %>%
    summarise_all(mean) %>%
    mutate_all(floor) %>%
    mutate(n = paste("N =", n))
}

map((1:2) * 10, col_stats)

map_dfr((1:2) * 10, col_stats)
```

---

# Not covered: `pluck()` {-}

- `pluck()` will pull a single element from a list

```{r}
my_list <- list(
  1:3,
  10 + (1:5),
  20 + (1:10)
)

pluck(my_list, 1)

map(my_list, pluck, 1)

map_dbl(my_list, pluck, 1)
```

---

# Not covered: `flatten()` {-}

- `flatten()` will turn a list of lists into a simpler vector

```{r}
my_list <-
  list(
    a = 1:3,
    b = list(1:3)
  )

map_if(my_list, is.list, pluck)

map_if(my_list, is.list, flatten_int)

map_if(my_list, is.list, flatten_int) %>%
  flatten_int()
```
# Application {-}

- parsing JSON or XML

```{r}
library(repurrrsive)

repos <-
  repurrrsive::gh_repos %>%
  purrr::flatten()


str(repos[[1]], list.len = 10)
```
# Application {-}
```{r}
tibble(
  repo_id = map_int(repos, pluck, "id"),
  repo_name = map_chr(repos, pluck, "name"),
  owner_name =
    map(repos, pluck, "owner") %>%
    map_chr(pluck, "login"),
  size = map_int(repos, pluck, "size"),
  issues = map_int(repos, pluck, "open_issues_count"),
  watchers = map_int(repos, pluck, "watchers_count"),
  forks = map_int(repos, pluck, "forks_count"),
  created_at = map_chr(repos, pluck, "created_at")
) %>%
  arrange(desc(watchers))
```
