# Control flow

**Learning objectives:**

- Learn the **tools** for controlling flow of execution.

- Learn some technical pitfalls and (perhaps lesser known) useful features.

## Introduction

There are two main groups of flow control tools: **choices** and **loops**: 

- Choices (`if`, `switch`, `ifelse`, `dplyr::if_else`, `dplyr::case_when`) allow you to run different code depending on the input. 
    
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat`) allow you to repeatedly run code 


---


## Choices



`if()` and `else`

Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. 



```{r eval=FALSE, include=T}
if (test_expression) {   
  true_action
} else {
  false_action
}
```

(Note braces are only *needed* for compound expressions)

Can be expanded to more alternatives:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (test_expression) {   
  true_action
} else if (other_test_expression) {
  other_action
} else {
  false_action
}
```

## Exercise {-}
Why does this work?
```
x <- 1:10
if (length(x)) "not empty" else "empty"
#> [1] "not empty"

x <- numeric()
if (length(x)) "not empty" else "empty"
#> [1] "empty"
```

## Invalid inputs {-}

- *Condition* must evaluate to a *single* `TRUE` or `FALSE`, otherwise (usually) an error

- Exception is a logical vector of length greater than 1, which only generates a warning, unless you have `_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_` set to `TRUE`, which might be the default now?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1
#>Error in if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 : the condition has length > 1
```

## Vectorized choices {-}

- `ifelse()` is a vectorized version of `if`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
ifelse(x %% 5 == 0, "XXX", as.character(x))
#>  [1] "1"   "2"   "3"   "4"   "XXX" "6"   "7"   "8"   "9"   "XXX"

ifelse(x %% 2 == 0, "even", "odd")
#>  [1] "odd"  "even" "odd"  "even" "odd"  "even" "odd"  "even" "odd"  "even"
```

-  `dplyr::if_else()`

- Book recommends only using `ifelse()`  "only when the yes and no vectors are the same type as it is otherwise hard to predict the output type." 

- `dplyr::if_else()` enforces this recommendation.

**For example:**

```{r eval=FALSE, include=T}
ifelse(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE),"a",3)
#> [1] "a" "a" "3"
dplyr::if_else(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE),"a",3)
#> Error in `dplyr::if_else()`:
#> ! `false` must be a character vector, not a double vector.
```
 
## Switch {-}

Rather then string together multiple if - else if chains, you can often use `switch`.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(stats)
centre <- function(x, type) {
  switch(type,
         mean = mean(x),
         median = median(x),
         trimmed = mean(x, trim = .1))
}

set.seed(123)
x <- rlnorm(100)

centers <- data.frame(type = c('mean', 'median', 'trimmed'))
centers$value = sapply(centers$type, \(t){centre(x,t)})

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x), aes(x))+
  geom_density()+
  geom_vline(data = centers, 
             mapping = aes(color = type, xintercept = value), 
             size=0.5,linetype="dashed") +
  xlim(-1,10)+
  theme_bw()
```

## Using `dplyr::case_when` {-}

- `case_when` is a more general `if_else` and can be used often in place multiple chained `if_else` or sapply'ing `switch`.

- It uses a special syntax to allow any number of condition-vector pairs:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
centers <- data.frame(type = c('mean', 'median', 'trimmed'))
centers$value = dplyr::case_when(centers$type == 'mean' ~ mean(x),
                                 centers$type == 'median' ~ median(x),
                                 centers$type == 'trimmed' ~ mean(x, trim = 0.1))
centers
```

 

## Loops

- Iteration over a elements of a vector

`for (item in vector) perform_action`

**First example**
```{r}
for(i in 1:5) {
  print(1:i)
}
```


**Second example**: terminate a *for loop* earlier

- `next` skips rest of current iteration
- `break` exits the loop entirely

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i < 3) 
    next

  print(i)
  
  if (i >= 5)
    break
}
```

## Exercise {-}

When the following code is evaluated, what can you say about the vector being iterated?
```
xs <- c(1, 2, 3)
for (x in xs) {
  xs <- c(xs, x * 2)
}
xs
#> [1] 1 2 3 2 4 6
```

## Pitfalls {-}

- Preallocate output containers to avoid *slow* code. 

- Beware that `1:length(v)` when `v` has length 0 results in a iterating backwards over `1:0`, probably not what is intended.  Use `seq_along(v)` instead.

- When iterating over S3 vectors, use  `[[]]` yourself to avoid stripping attributes. 

```
xs <- as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2010-01-01"))
for (x in xs) {
  print(x)
}
#> [1] 18262
#> [1] 14610
```
vs. 
```
for (i in seq_along(xs)) {
  print(xs[[i]])
}
#> [1] "2020-01-01"
#> [1] "2010-01-01"
```

## Related tools {-}

- `while(condition) action`: performs action while condition is TRUE.
- `repeat(action)`: repeats action forever (i.e. until it encounters break).

- Note that `for` can be rewritten as `while` and while can be rewritten as `repeat` (this goes in one direction only!);  *however*:

>Good practice is to use the least-flexible solution to a problem, so you should use `for` wherever possible.
BUT you shouldn't even use for loops for data analysis tasks as `map()` and `apply()` already provide *less flexible* solutions to most problems. (More in Chapter 9.)

00:40:18	Ryan Honomichl:	What type of vector does each of the following calls to ifelse() return?

* "ifelse returns a value with the same shape as test which is filled with elements selected from either yes or no depending on whether the element of test is TRUE or FALSE."
00:42:11	Ryan Honomichl:	"I recommend assigning the results of an if statement only when the entire expression fits on one line; otherwise it tends to be hard to read"
00:42:46	Ryan Honomichl:	* When you use the single argument form without an `else` statement, `if` invisibly returns NULL if the condition is FALSE. 

-   Since functions like c() and paste() drop NULL inputs, this allows for a compact expression of certain idioms
