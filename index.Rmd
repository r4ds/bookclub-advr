Welcome to the bookclub! 

This is a companion for the book [_Advanced R_](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham (Chapman & Hall, copyright 2019, [9780815384571](https://www.routledge.com/Advanced-R-Second-Edition/Wickham/p/book/9780815384571)).
This companion is available at [dslc.io/advr](https://dslc.io/advr).

This website is being developed by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io). Follow along, and [join the community](https://dslc.io/join) to participate.

This companion follows the [Data Science Learning Community Code of Conduct](https://dslc.io/conduct).

## Book club meetings {-}

- Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter).
  - **This is the best way to learn the material.**
- Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.
- More information about how to present is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-advr).
- Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the [Data Science Learning Community YouTube Channel](https://dslc.io/youtube).
  - Camera is optional, but encouraged.
- If we need to slow down and discuss, let me or the speaker know.
  - A lot can be learned from a discussion.
  - Most likely someone has the same question.
  - We are all here to learn.

## Pace {-}

- We'll _try_ to cover 1 chapter/week, but...
- ...It's ok to split chapters when they feel like too much.
- We will try to meet every week, but will likely take some breaks for holidays, etc.
- The session will be exactly one hour. 
- I encourage the group to adopt a 'go no matter what' mentality.

## Group introductions {-}

- If you feel comfortable sharing:
  - Who are you?
  - Where you calling in from? (If you're not comfortable sharing, skip)
  - How long have you been using R?
  - What was your introduction to R?
  - What are you most looking forward to during the group?

## `git` and `GitHub` {-}

- If you are unfamilar with these tools, it's best to use the workflows made easy by the `usethis` package.
  - [Managing Git(Hub) credentials](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).
  - [Pull request helpers](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html).
  - [Check out the notes `README.md` file for exact steps](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-advr#readme).
  - The community (especially `@jonthegeek`) and myself (`@Collin Berke`) are there to help.
  - This is a great opportunity to become more comfortable with these tools.

- If you're comforable with `git` and `GitHub`: 
  - Fork the repo.
  - Create a branch with an informative name. 
  - Submit a pull request via the `DSLC` repo of the book. 
  - PR's are automatically tested and reviewed before being merged.

## Resources to learn more about `git` and GitHub {-}

- There are so many tools to use `git` and interface with `GitHub`.
  - If you just want to stick with what is familiar, just use the `usethis` package.
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).
- [`usethis`'s pull request helpers](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html).
- [`git`'s documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).
